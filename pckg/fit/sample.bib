    abstract = {We present a dispersive imaging method for trapped quantum gases based on digital off-axis holography. Both phase delay and intensity of the probe field are determined from the same image. Due to the heterodyne gain inherent to the holographic method, it is possible to retrieve the phase delay induced by the atoms at probe beam doses two orders of magnitude lower than phase-contrast imaging methods. Using the full field of the probe beam, we numerically correct for image defocusing.},

    abstract={Collisions in a thermal gas are perceived as random or incoherent as a consequence of the large numbers of initial and final quantum states accessible to the system. In a quantum gas, for example, a Bose--Einstein condensate or a degenerate Fermi gas, the phase space accessible to low-energy collisions is so restricted that collisions become coherent and reversible. Here, we report the observation of coherent spin-changing collisions in a gas of spin-1 bosons. Starting with condensates occupying two spin states, a condensate in the third spin state is coherently and reversibly created by atomic collisions. The observed dynamics are analogous to Josephson oscillations in weakly connected superconductors and represent a type of matter--wave four-wave mixing. The spin-dependent scattering length is determined from these oscillations to be −1.45(32) bohr. Finally, we demonstrate coherent control of the evolution of the system by applying differential phase shifts to the spin states using magnetic fields.},

The type and number of defects are determined by calculating the first and second homotopy groups of the order-parameter space. The order-parameter space is identified with a set of degenerate ground state spinors. Because the structure of the ground state depends on whether or not there is an external magnetic field applied to the system, defects are sensitive to the magnetic field. We study both cases and find that the defects in zero and non-zero field are different.}

    abstract={Bose--Einstein condensates --- a low-temperature form of matter in which a macroscopic population of bosons occupies the quantum-mechanical ground state --- have been demonstrated for weakly interacting, dilute gases of alkali-metal1,2,3 and hydrogen25 atoms. Magnetic traps are usually employed to confine the condensates, but have the drawback that spin flips in the atoms lead to untrapped states. For this reason, the spin orientation of the trapped alkali atoms cannot be regarded as a degree of freedom. Such condensates are therefore described by a scalar order parameter, like the spinless superfluid 4He. In contrast, a recently realized optical trap4 for sodium condensates confines atoms independently of their spin orientations. This offers the possibility of studying `spinor' condensates in which spin comprises a degree of freedom, so that the order parameter is a vector rather than scalar quantity. Here we report the observation of equilibrium states of sodium spinor condensates in an optical trap. The freedom of spin orientation leads to the formation of spin domains in an external magnetic field, which can be either miscible or immiscible with one another.},

abstract={Many-body systems at low temperatures generally organize themselves into ordered phases, whose nature and symmetries are captured by an order parameter. This order parameter is spatially uniform in the simplest cases, for example the macroscopic magnetization of a ferromagnetic material. Non-uniform situations also exist in nature, for instance in antiferromagnetic materials, where the magnetization alternates in space, or in the so-called stripe phases emerging for itinerant electrons in strongly correlated materials. Understanding such inhomogeneously ordered states is of central importance in many-body physics. Here we study experimentally the magnetic ordering of itinerant spin-1 bosons in inhomegeneous spin domains at nano-Kelvin temperatures. We demonstrate that spin domains form spontaneously, that is purely because of the antiferromagnetic interactions between the atoms and in the absence of external magnetic forces, after a phase separation transition. Furthermore, we explore how the equilibrium domain configuration emerges from an initial state prepared far from equilibrium.},

Careful tuning of the light frequency can isolate either of these two effects.
