20210412 - 0085:   Good transition sequence.
20210412 - 0086:   Good transition sequence.
20210412 - 0087:   Good transition sequence.
20210412 - 0088:   Good transition sequence.
20210412 - 0098:   Also a good transition run.
20210412 - 0099:   The good runs for the transitions.
20210603 - 0008:   Finally something. Small, but decent.
20210603 - 0019:   This looks quite decent as well, # of atoms ~ 21 M
20210603 - 0022:   At aroudn 76 seconds, no more atoms - but also, we are not using any nitrogen here.
20210603 - 0027:   Decent number, decent image.
20210603 - 0088:   Yo, a BEC here, even though we had no N2 today.
20210603 - 0089:   BEC
20210603 - 0090:   BEC
20210603 - 0091:   BEC
20210603 - 0092:   BEC
20210603 - 0093:   BEC
20210603 - 0095:   Check it, a nice and long boy!
20210604 - 0043:   At tof 7 we see things, not at higher tof's
20210604 - 0052:   Loop here onwards (2, 2, 3, 3, ..., 10, 10) - let's see how tof affects it in our experiment
20210604 - 0063:   Seems to look best at tof = 7ms, why?
20210604 - 0151:   Yo !
20210604 - 0154:   Still with old curves from the 20210602 TI_decom script.
20210604 - 0155:   Still with old curves from the 20210602 TI_decom script.
20210604 - 0156:   Modified curves.
20210604 - 0161:   With the comp disabled.
20210604 - 0162:   RF Hold2 and RF3 disabled
20210604 - 0163:   RF Hold2 and RF3 disabled
20210604 - 0164:   RF Hold2 and RF3 disabled at lower rftime
20210604 - 0168:   Oh
20210604 - 0169:   No
20210604 - 0170:   Eh
20210604 - 0171:   Yes
20210604 - 0172:   Yes
20210604 - 0173:   Eh
20210604 - 0174:   Decompressed trap - we see some atoms.
20210604 - 0179:   
20210604 - 0184:   With modified curves.
20210604 - 0185:   With modified curves. Doesn't look good. Looks like nothing. The MOT seems quite decent though
20210607 - 0023:   About 120 M particles according to our fit.
20210607 - 0028:   Nice.
20210607 - 0029:   Not nice.
20210607 - 0033:   Try more RF cooling, nothing to see here.
20210607 - 0048:   Really interesting thermal cloud wings
20210607 - 0059:   RF3 = 18 (RF3 is the third RF cooling part, when we decompress the trap)
20210607 - 0060:   RF3 = 18
20210607 - 0061:   RF3 = 10
20210607 - 0062:   RF3 = 10
20210607 - 0063:   RF3 = 5
20210607 - 0064:   RF3 = 5
20210607 - 0065:   Brand new RF curve (as the one from 20210602)
20210607 - 0066:   After decomp RF3 = 20 s
20210607 - 0068:   Changed nothing - still disappeared a bit
20210607 - 0072:   Left it running through lunch, but we had no nitrogen, so no condensates.  But also no MOT.
20210607 - 0107:   Back with nitrogen, back with condensates. RF3 = 20
20210607 - 0115:   Nice, back in business.
20210607 - 0117:   at RF3 = 21
20210607 - 0129:   Nothing here, this is odd, same conditions as before, we have a nice MOT and Nitrogen running normally. Odd.
20210607 - 0130:   
20210607 - 0131:   Still nothing, even though this is without any decompression.
20210607 - 0137:   I mean, great gret stuff.
20210607 - 0138:   Great as well, a tiny bit smaller than the previous one.
20210607 - 0139:   Yet even smaller than the last. It seems like we're loosing it over the period of few minutes.
20210607 - 0140:   And it's gone, what
20210607 - 0142:   Back again. But small, but tof 0 here.
20210607 - 0146:   Not bad, the shape seems a bit funky almost, no?
20210607 - 0176:   A fabulous one! the problem in the script was that the Probe AOM has to be on.
20210607 - 0178:   Here the P/B current was dropped from 5 - 0.5 V, thus a bit chunkier.
20210607 - 0179:   
20210607 - 0180:   Hell yeah - long and nice, slightly out of center, might want to fix that.
20210607 - 0181:   Hell yeah
20210607 - 0183:   Going to OAH, this one is waste, forgot the power meter in the beam path.
20210607 - 0184:   Forgot the power meter in, LOL
20210607 - 0192:   Switched to less decompression
20210607 - 0195:   So this doesn't work. The AOH analysis here, fix that.
20210607 - 0197:   But we don't see anything, so let's increase the RF time
20210607 - 0205:   Back to top imaging, we have a beautiful cloud. So that is not the problem
20210607 - 0206:   To imaging again, but it seems great, so we're going back to OAH.
20210607 - 0207:   Unbelivable, 2/2, forgot the power meter in again.
20210607 - 0209:   Maybe the best one around here.
20210607 - 0210:   Including extra thold time and tofcomp
20210607 - 0212:   Eh, maybe it' pointless. Let's perhaps try the other polarization
20210607 - 0215:   
20210607 - 0216:   Other polarization, safe to say a hit and a miss.
20210607 - 0217:   Empty again. Let's wrap up.
20210608 - 0000:   NO NITROGEN TODAY - Lights were on here, so waste pic.
20210608 - 0001:   Power meter in, waste pic, AGAIN NEJC COMEON you're better than that
20210608 - 0002:   Works, but nothing to see, because well, no nitrogen today.
20210608 - 0003:   
20210608 - 0004:   Decreased RF time 44 to 40, let's aim for the thermal cloud.
20210608 - 0005:   Cool, something here, but it's wider than I remember yesterday.
20210608 - 0007:   Nothing here.
20210608 - 0008:   Nothing here. RF 40 to 42. We should go check if nitrogen is ready.
20210608 - 0010:   Lowered RF2 even lower.
20210608 - 0011:   Let's keep it running at these settings over lunch.
20210608 - 0027:   Again, damn!
20210608 - 0032:   Damn!
20210608 - 0043:   Blurred here as well
20210608 - 0044:   Something small here.
20210608 - 0048:   And all of a sudden it appears.
20210608 - 0059:   Cloud
20210608 - 0064:   Cloud
20210608 - 0071:   Cloud
20210608 - 0072:   Cloud
20210608 - 0081:   Cloud
20210608 - 0083:   Cloud
20210608 - 0084:   Cloud
20210608 - 0085:   Cloud
20210608 - 0086:   Cloud
20210608 - 0087:   Cloud
20210608 - 0092:   With lights on - so a waste image.
20210609 - 0000:   Good start I'd say
20210609 - 0007:   A bit more like it, this is again a thin cloud we had two days ago. We simply disabled the Copy of Hold channel, which had 1.103 seconds of RF Active off before imaging.
20210609 - 0011:   Gone. Let's try to decrease the ratio of the cloud by modifying the current in P/B.
20210609 - 0014:   Nice, ratio of about 16. Let's try to cool off more thermal cloud, cool longer.
20210609 - 0015:   Eh
20210609 - 0017:   Doesn't look bad at all. Still some thermal wings on the sides.
20210609 - 0018:   Looks quite decent.
20210609 - 0019:   Nice, this PB seems good.
20210609 - 0020:   Changed the RF Curve here @ 50s 4.3 -> 4.0
20210609 - 0023:   
20210609 - 0024:   Added another RF point @50s, at 3.4
20210609 - 0026:   I mean it seems good, but there still seems to be a lot of shot-to-shot fluctuations in the size of the cloud.
20210609 - 0027:   Good good - let's try to see if we can also get to the "original", non decompressed shape using this script.
20210609 - 0028:   Non-decompressed trap - looks good, note that we used different RF curves.
20210609 - 0029:   Non-decompressed trap - looks good, note that we used different RF curves.
20210609 - 0030:   Non-decompressed trap - looks good, note that we used different RF curves.
20210609 - 0031:   Non-decompressed trap - looks good, note that we used different RF curves.
20210609 - 0032:   Great stuff.
20210609 - 0033:   Nice, let's do one more and then go to OAH.
20210609 - 0034:   Also nice, and reliable.
20210609 - 0035:   OAH Here onwards. This one is empty though.
20210609 - 0037:   Something small. Not a lot though.
20210609 - 0040:   No decompression here. No condensate to be seen either.
20210609 - 0057:   exposure time 0.00045. Not good
20210609 - 0089:   With longer exposure time - doesn't make much of a difference - we need longer pre-trig pulse.
20210609 - 0099:   Made with the 20210606 script we also used in absorption img. There is something although very vague
20210609 - 0110:   Using one of the old scripts, niceish image
20210609 - 0111:   Niceish
20210609 - 0112:   
20210609 - 0113:   Let's go back to Top imaging, and optimize there.
20210609 - 0114:   Still had the OAH setup here, but with the correct detuning of the probe frequency.
20210609 - 0115:   Only thermal cloud with 7ms TOF - but the fitted atom number seems very low (we had to estimate the trapping frequency slightly).
20210609 - 0116:   With 7ms TOF - but the fitted atom number seems very low (we had to estimate the trapping frequency slightly) - no decompression.
20210609 - 0123:   Okay, so we are realtively confident that we are not in fact getting a condensate in those runs (we are simply not cooling low enough). So let's first try to optimize the curve for cooling to the condensate level, and then combine that with the decompression time as well.
20210609 - 0124:   From an older script, makes a nice but small BEC.
20210609 - 0125:   From an older script, makes a nice but small BEC.
20210609 - 0126:   Brought the curves to the current script, not quite a BEC, let's run it again.
20210609 - 0127:   A bit better. Might still need to modify the curves a bit.
20210609 - 0128:   Condensate here.
20210609 - 0132:   But not here
20210609 - 0133:   But not here
20210609 - 0143:   End of the day not so good.
20210610 - 0023:   Nice condensate, but the only one in the first 27 runs. Why?
20210610 - 0028:   Still nothing. Let's lower the RF time and see if we are cooling it off. The MOT seems good, by the way.
20210610 - 0029:   Looks real nice.
20210610 - 0030:   Nice as well.
20210610 - 0031:   Coolio ish, we have about 113 M particles here, according to estimates of the trapping frequencies.
20210610 - 0032:   Also nice, some slight fluctuations, which are not ideal, but at least we see the thermal cloud on every run. So why don't we see condensates?
20210610 - 0033:   We're loosing it, why?
20210610 - 0034:   And good again - about 115 M particles
20210610 - 0035:   Higher RF time, still a good image at 75.
20210610 - 0036:   Same, seems consistent.
20210610 - 0038:   Looks good, and seems reliable.
20210610 - 0039:   Seems fine, a nice thermal cloud. Let's also quickly chekc if TOF has some effect on this.
20210610 - 0040:   Seems fine, a nice thermal cloud. Let's also quickly chekc if TOF has some effect on this.
20210610 - 0041:   At 7 works fine.
20210610 - 0051:   Modified the RF curves.
20210610 - 0060:   Some nice runs with these settings
20210610 - 0061:   Ya boi! After this run, had to replace the nitrogen hose, meaning also heating up the ion getter.
20210610 - 0063:   Okay, not quite what we left off with, but still a large amount of the thermal cloud present.
20210610 - 0064:   Okay, better and better.
20210610 - 0065:   Yeah, this amount of cooling is just on the limit it seems - after lunch, let's modify the curves a bit.
20210610 - 0066:   Seems like that at 81 seconds we are just cooling it off a bit too much.
20210610 - 0085:   Begins to dissapear. And the next run is empty. It has to be something with an effect on a minute scale - and that also affect is when we cool further. Perhaps some coil stuff?
20210610 - 0086:   Gone. Hm
20210610 - 0088:   Looks great, low amounts of the thermal cloud.
20210610 - 0089:   One second less cooling, correspondingly more thermal cloud.
20210610 - 0094:   Nice, some thermal cloud though, so let's explore how we can get rid of that maybe, by including another second of cooling but perhaps just very very slight modification to the last point on the curve.
20210610 - 0095:   Some thermal cloud, let's increse the cooling time again
20210610 - 0096:   Reasonable. Very consistent runs though.
20210610 - 0097:   Nice! Almost no thermal cloud.
20210610 - 0113:   0 tof
20210610 - 0119:   With decompression, modified curve
20210610 - 0120:   No decompression, modified curve
20210610 - 0121:   Same as below
20210610 - 0123:   Empty. With a longer curve, adapted for the decompression. But without any decompression.
20210610 - 0127:   Nothing
20210610 - 0128:   Nothing here
20210610 - 0129:   Neither
20210610 - 0130:   Yeah we have stuff here, seems more elongated - Coolio!
20210610 - 0131:   Nice
20210610 - 0132:   Nice
20210610 - 0133:   Nice at 0 tof
20210610 - 0134:   Gone. Hell.
20210610 - 0135:   And just like that it's gone.
20210610 - 0136:   .
20210610 - 0137:   .
20210610 - 0149:   Back to the curve we had before, which worked.
20210610 - 0150:   Letting it set fixes and creates a nice condensate
20210610 - 0151:   Still there, but smaller. It seems to fluctuate qutie some.
20210610 - 0152:   Lot's of thermal cloud, pretty much what we saw before
20210610 - 0153:   Empty. - RF Time higher than 0152 though
20210610 - 0158:   At around 40 s RF time2 we seem to consistently have the thermal cloud.
20210610 - 0163:   RF2 21 seconds.
20210610 - 0165:   Modified the curve again, empty again.
20210610 - 0166:   Empty.
20210610 - 0168:   Condensate here.
20210610 - 0176:   Going to a different script - let's simplify things and do RF till T_c, then decompress, then RF to the other side.
20210610 - 0191:   Camera not working
20210610 - 0192:   Camera not working
20210614 - 0021:   seems reasonable but cant get fit to work
20210614 - 0024:   Got fit to work, little bit of condensate
20210614 - 0080:   Lower RF time, maybe nitrogen was being bad
20210614 - 0083:   This is nice at RF 76, see if it stays stable and try compression soon. Nitrogen is going wild so might have to reduce that
20210614 - 0086:   Attempt with Jaspers RF compr2 and RF decomp2 curves, nothing...
20210614 - 0089:   Without decompression but WITH RF2 hold 20s and RF3
20210614 - 0090:   Again no decompression but with 20s hold and RF3. So the decompression is making us lose the cloud. Cool more with RF3 maybe?
20210614 - 0100:   decompressed to 0.7V RF3 turned off. We might be losing it in donig RF3.
20210614 - 0102:   tof 1
20210614 - 0103:   RF3 enabled, at 5 seconds
20210614 - 0104:   Basically, how it works: RF1 + RF2, cooling for about 78 seconds, then decompress for 20 seconds, and then RF3.
20210614 - 0105:   At RF3=10 its empty
20210614 - 0106:   10 is too much tof apparently
20210614 - 0107:   RF3 = 7, still have it here.
20210614 - 0108:   RF3 = 7, still have it
20210614 - 0109:   RF3 = 8
20210614 - 0110:   Also 8.
20210614 - 0111:   RF3 = 9 Still looking good. Why do we lose it at 10 then?
20210614 - 0113:   RF10. Obviously were losing it around here...
20210614 - 0114:   
20210615 - 0023:   With decompression and RF3=7
20210615 - 0024:   Also RF3=7, not great but there is something.
20210615 - 0026:   Also at RF3=3, more is visible
20210615 - 0027:   RF3=3
20210615 - 0028:   RF3=5
20210615 - 0029:   Also RF3=5, losing around here?
20210615 - 0030:   RF3=6
20210615 - 0031:   RF3=6, disapperaring
20210615 - 0032:   RF3=4, here it looks better. Maybe cool of more horizontal instead of deeper?
20210615 - 0033:   RF3=4, its a bit less good
20210615 - 0035:   altered curve at RF3=7, seems a bit better at such a high time
20210615 - 0036:   Now its a bit less, curve might have settled
20210615 - 0037:   it gets weaker
20210615 - 0038:   New curve that goes quite deep, now theres nothing
20210615 - 0040:   A different curve, starting at RF =4hz ending at 3.25 Hz
20210615 - 0044:   New curve, RF3=3
20210615 - 0046:   RF3=4, looks better
20210615 - 0047:   But this is also 4 and its not taht good...
20210615 - 0050:   New curve that barely changes, might have to settle into it...
20210615 - 0053:   MOT isnt very good...
20210615 - 0060:   This is nothing at RF3=0. probably because the MOT is so bad
20210615 - 0072:   Relocked lazer, now it seems to be back at Rf3=0
20210615 - 0074:   RF3=4, now with good MOT it seems nice
20210615 - 0075:   Also RF3=4 but now its disappearing...
20210615 - 0076:   RF3=6.. now it looks good.
20210615 - 0084:   At RF3=5 we really are seeing it.
20210615 - 0087:   RF3=7, this curve seems better...
20210615 - 0088:   This is at RF3=8 but it seems to disappear rather than condense
20210615 - 0090:   New curve at Rf3=8
20210615 - 0092:   This is at RF3=9... it seems like we are losing it around an RF frequency of 3.6 Hz. Might have to cool more horizontal around that point?
20210615 - 0093:   Oh but now it looks nice, try again
20210615 - 0094:   Also good at Rf3=9
20210615 - 0095:   <this is at Rf3=10
20210615 - 0097:   Rf3=11, a bit smaller
20210616 - 0000:   Get started without any decompression /RF3. RF2=10. Mot is a bit weak
20210616 - 0001:   Looks decent at RF=70, tof 10
20210616 - 0003:   Looks good enough, MOT is decent. Struggling a bit with the nitrogen
20210616 - 0004:   Looks good enough. Do some decompression runs next to settle into those curves
20210616 - 0005:   Decompression, RF2=18, RF3=20. Curve with which we ended yesterday. Let it settle a bit
20210616 - 0008:   Not great, both nitrogen and MOT could be better
20210616 - 0010:   Relocked lazers -> Better MOT, set nitrogen a bit harder and this looks better already
20210616 - 0011:   Also decent, a bit smaller though
20210616 - 0012:   Again MOT was a bit weaker. Time to check the powers
20210616 - 0013:   After checking power and relocking lazers. MOT and nitrogen all seemed fine... maybe it has to settle a bit?
20210616 - 0014:   Mot was good here. Nitrogen was good and it looks nice.
20210616 - 0015:   Not very good MOT but lets start playing with the curve a bit now...
20210616 - 0016:   Disappearing, because of deeper curve or bad MOT?
20210616 - 0017:   Maybe the curve had to settle a bit
20210616 - 0018:   This had a pretty good MOT yet it is disappearing
20210616 - 0020:   Raised curve again.. Barely anything. Why is MOT so unstable???
20210616 - 0022:   Trying to make a BEC without any decompression, seems close but not quite it. Could be that curve has to settle
20210616 - 0024:   Nothing really... but we are out of nitrogen which could explain that
20210616 - 0025:   Decompression enabled again, rf3 = 20s, empty. Probably as were out of nitrogen
20210616 - 0038:   RF=76, no decomp
20210616 - 0042:   Rf2=81, hello Mr condensate. So we are able to condense without decompression
20210616 - 0043:   Another one. Now lets try to get this going WITH decompression
20210616 - 0044:   Empty, with decompression and RF3=20
20210616 - 0047:   Its very empty when were trying to decompress
20210616 - 0049:   This is very strange, even at 0 RF3 were not getting anything
20210616 - 0052:   back to an old curve
20210616 - 0054:   Altered curve, goes a bit lower on last step
20210616 - 0056:   This curve goes a bit lower, still no condensate
20210616 - 0060:   Old curve but with extra timestem t=25 at 3.63 Hz
20210616 - 0065:   It is moving...
20210616 - 0066:   This obviously cools too deep
20210616 - 0068:   This looks like its going the right direction, with an extra step RF3 t=25, 3.6 Hz
20210616 - 0070:   Goes a bit deeper at t=20, 3.61 Hz
20210616 - 0072:   Not quite as good, cooling off too much?
20210616 - 0076:   This looks a bit better, at t=25 RF=3.599 Hz
20210616 - 0078:   Now were going to 3.6 Hz at t=20 already but that might be too fast
20210616 - 0082:   Back to a bit older curve that goes to 3.6hz in 25 seconds
20210616 - 0084:   Extra timestep at 30s going to 3.59 Hz but that seems a bit too deep
20210616 - 0096:   Again it shifted although i changed nothing... weird
20210617 - 0000:   Get started at no decomp. RF=70 tof=10. Nothing to see yet...
20210617 - 0001:   Empty
20210617 - 0002:   RF=70, tof=10, were seeing ~38 million thermal atoms
20210617 - 0003:   RF 60 tof 10, a bit diffuse
20210617 - 0004:   Another one at RF=60, tof=10
20210617 - 0005:   RF=78, tof=10. A bit small. Maybe soon see if we can condense without decompression?
20210617 - 0006:   Another at RF=78, tof=10. Its not that good...
20210617 - 0007:   Nice enough, 11 mil thermal atoms is not a lot though
20210617 - 0009:   This is at RF=81, should be condensed but nitrogen is not fully flowing yet
20210617 - 0011:   Were probably not condensing as the curve only goes to t=18...
20210617 - 0012:   Now we've probably cooled it off too much
20210617 - 0014:   empty
20210617 - 0016:   trying decompression at RF2=18, RF3=20 going down to 3.6 Hz. There is somethign here
20210617 - 0018:   Almost empty, struggling a bit with MOT
20210617 - 0021:   Tried an older curve which worked good yesterday. Now its empty.
20210617 - 0023:   Its finally getting a bit better...
20210617 - 0024:   It shifted again. MOT was good
20210617 - 0026:   Lets leave it running for a bit
20210617 - 0030:   This is again going somewhere, lets cool deepers
20210617 - 0033:   We just got to cool deepers
20210617 - 0041:   Cooling deeper and it seems to be fine
20210617 - 0043:   Lowered curve but now its less
20210617 - 0046:   Okay nice, strange that we can suddenly go this deep. Lets go deepers
20210617 - 0054:   I think we have to go lower for condensation and then make an extended tail
20210617 - 0055:   Make curve a bit deeper and leave running over lunch. Lets see...
20210617 - 0072:   This one is nice, maybe cool deeper during lunch?
20210617 - 0078:   Apparently it already started appearing here!
20210617 - 0085:   Walked back from lunch and saw this!! A small, but decompressed condensate!!!
20210617 - 0086:   Ofcourse it disappears right at the moment you start getting excited...
20210617 - 0087:   Extended the curve to last a bit longer RF3=27s
20210617 - 0088:   Lets make the curve overal a bit deeper again
20210617 - 0089:   MOT wasnt very good though
20210617 - 0090:   Again a condensate!! Save this curve and lets optimize a bit more to make it bigger
20210617 - 0091:   Again nice, try increasing RF time in next run?
20210617 - 0092:   RF3=27s at final time step 3.200 at t=30s, big boi
20210617 - 0093:   Latest one, also very nice
20210617 - 0094:   Great stuff!! (Dont understand why fitting doesnt work)
20210617 - 0095:   This is amazing!! Still a bit of T cloud left which we might want to cool off
20210617 - 0096:   This is at RF3=28, not as good.
20210617 - 0097:   Now its better at RF3=28, it might've had to settle into that curve
20210617 - 0098:   Nice BEC
20210617 - 0099:   At tof=0, its quite nicely stretched but still some thermal cloud to work away
20210617 - 0101:   RF3=29, another epic condensate but still some cloud to cool off
20210617 - 0102:   These clouds seem to jump around
20210617 - 0104:   It shifted and its a bit smaller, weird...
20210617 - 0105:   TOF=0, the condensate does not look that stretched though... Maybe becuase of bad MOT?
20210617 - 0106:   this is a bit nicer at tof=0, but we might want to decompress even more?
20210617 - 0108:   Tried to stretch it more by going down to P/B=0.5V but now we lost the condensate
20210617 - 0114:   Back to old curve with decompression to 0.7 V
20210617 - 0121:   With a smaller camera and setting ready for HI. Lets go to HI next...
20210617 - 0127:   Tried a higher exposure time but that doesnt work
20210617 - 0134:   Back to TI. Tof here disabled.
20210618 - 0000:   Starting the day with this cloud at RF=60, tof=10
20210618 - 0005:   Went to RF=70
20210618 - 0007:   This is a nice one for RF=70
20210618 - 0008:   why does the fitting not work?
20210618 - 0009:   RF=78
20210618 - 0012:   Trying decompression, nothing there ofcourse... Might need to cool less now.
20210618 - 0016:   Also empty, annoying that the RF is so sensitive to starting conditions...
20210618 - 0018:   There it is, at RF3=20, but its not condensed. Lets slowly ramp up the RF3 time
20210618 - 0020:   RF3=22, not quite a condensate yet
20210618 - 0021:   And now its empty at RF3=22...
20210618 - 0025:   Also emtpy at RF3=20... annoying
20210618 - 0027:   Found it back around RF3=18
20210618 - 0032:   And at 20 its gone again, so frustrating
20210618 - 0034:   I mean.. it looks close to condensation. Try raising the tail of the curve
20210618 - 0037:   Not sure if its a condensate but its close. RF3=23 at 3.8hz at timestep 25
20210618 - 0063:   MOT also has issues
20210618 - 0069:   At RF3=0, MOT was a bit shitty. Lets check elazers after next one
20210618 - 0071:   Without any decompression at RF=78 we get this nice cloud
20210618 - 0072:   Maybe were too close to condensation and then decompressing?
20210618 - 0094:   RF3=5
20210623 - 0001:   Very bad MOT
20210623 - 0002:   It might have to settle a bit. Leave it running for a short time while eating
20210623 - 0009:   Nothing there... I should check the powers
20210623 - 0011:   Optimized powers a bit but MOT was still not very good...
20210623 - 0012:   This MOT was a bit better but theres still nothing
20210623 - 0013:   Finally seeing some atoms I guess.. leave it running for a bit while getting nitrogen
20210623 - 0033:   Finally were getting something interesting after relocking the lazers again. 128 mil thermal atoms
20210623 - 0034:   This is at TOF 7, looks good. Fitted with 135 mil thermal atoms RF=60
20210623 - 0035:   97 mil thermal atoms, not that much for RF=60, tof=7
20210623 - 0038:   Again around 92 mil thermal atoms, not that much for RF=60, tof=7
20210623 - 0039:   Only 75 mil thermal atoms, not that good...
20210623 - 0040:   This is at RF=70, tof 7 43 mil condensed atoms
20210623 - 0041:   Also RF=70, tof=7. Now only 30 mil thermal atoms
20210623 - 0042:   RF=78, tof=7. This already seems to be condensing a bit
20210623 - 0043:   Another one at RF=78, tof=7. This seems more thermal..
20210623 - 0044:   RF=78, tof=7 this looks condensed to me... Cannot fit. Lets try decompression again
20210623 - 0045:   Decompression works but its obviously not a condensate
20210623 - 0047:   This one did not have MOT
20210623 - 0049:   This seems to be going the right way. It also had a good MOt
20210623 - 0052:   It might need to settle a bit, although this stupid MOT is really unworkable
20210623 - 0055:   Went to RF3=23, but there was also barely a MOT...
20210623 - 0057:   With relocked lazers its better. It seems to be so MOT dependent... Might want to spend more time on realigning mirrors so it stays more stable
20210623 - 0058:   That is nice at RF3=22. Next try RF3=25 and see if we can get condensation
20210623 - 0059:   It seems to a be a bit condensed
20210623 - 0060:   Meh... it had a bad mot
20210623 - 0061:   It looks like a tiny condensate
20210623 - 0062:   This had a bad MOT, but the one coming next will have a good MOT
20210623 - 0063:   This is what we get with a good MOT... a very nice condensate. At RF3=27. See if we can get rid of thermal cloud and go to off axis
20210623 - 0068:   Condensate with lots of thermal cloud RF3=28
20210623 - 0069:   Another one at RF3=28. Lets use this curve in the off-axis sequence and optimize the thermal cloud away there
20210623 - 0070:   Camera fail
20210623 - 0073:   Looks nice but its difficutl to say how condensed it is without any TOF
20210623 - 0076:   Forgot to set camera
20210623 - 0077:   A condensate, finally
20210623 - 0078:   RF3=25, no condensate tof=7
20210623 - 0079:   Also RF3=25, not that good
20210623 - 0080:   RF3=28, tof=7, this is a nice condensate!
20210623 - 0082:   Mot just isnt good...
20210623 - 0084:   This is nice, it had a good enough MOT, RF3=30, tof=7. If this stays stable a bit we can go to off axis
20210623 - 0086:   It seems to be getting worse
20210623 - 0087:   This is nice, it had a good MOT at RF3=30. So the result seems more MOT dependent than RF dependent
20210623 - 0088:   RF3=29. Lets see it one more time without tof
20210623 - 0089:   A nice result for TOF=0
20210623 - 0092:   Nothing again but MOT is horrible, check powers
20210623 - 0094:   It seems we lost it... No idea how/why. Lets try some lower RF and if that doesnt work go back to TI
20210623 - 0095:   This line in the center is weird. Maybe some camera settings are still incorrect? Previous images did not have this though...
20210623 - 0096:   There is barely any interference... Because of bad lazers?
20210625 - 0000:   Seeing something although vague on the first shot of the day, RF60 tof7
20210625 - 0001:   A bit less, but lets let it run for a bit while getting coffee
20210625 - 0002:   Not quite a good atom number, 94 mil, for RF60 tof 7
20210625 - 0004:   MOT looks decent enough but we've certainly had better. I think the Zeeman beam has too low power which gives us not that many particles and a weak MOT
20210625 - 0006:   This isnt going anywhere proper. Lets optimize powers first and get better particle number before continueing
20210625 - 0007:   empty
20210625 - 0008:   Optimized powers but MOT is still horrible... why?
20210625 - 0014:   Well at least theres something...
20210625 - 0016:   66 mil thermal atoms is horrible
20210625 - 0017:   empty
20210625 - 0022:   This is unworkable... Really need to optimize those powers into a stable state. Apparently it drifts down badly during measurements
20210625 - 0024:   This is horrible. Time for lunch... Just let it run and hope it gets better I guess...
20210628 - 0062:   Here, optimized the polarization of the MOT XY beam
20210628 - 0065:   Where are all the atoms, why don't we see anything
20210630 - 0002:   Starting experiments at RF60 tof 10. Looks decent, 100 mil atoms
20210630 - 0005:   It slowly gets worse
20210630 - 0010:   Decided to optimize powers, repump was 3.4 -> 3.7. Zeeman was 130 ->144
20210630 - 0011:   Empty... Also Zeeman shifts at tof=10 maybe?
20210630 - 0013:   At tof 0 we see them again, 50 million atoms however is horrible
20210630 - 0014:   MOT looks great but atom number is horrible... Must be Zeeman... or Spinpol?
20210630 - 0016:   As a check I switched spinpol shut off but this gives way less particles... So spinpol is working fine. Zeeman power / polarisation might be the cause
20210630 - 0017:   Spinpol back on, but this particle number is horrible
20210630 - 0020:   RF=65
20210630 - 0022:   RF60, tof=7. MOT looks great, powers were decent. Why is the particle number so bad??? Let it run like this over lunch...
20210630 - 0057:   Started a list of RF 60 ->81 at tof=0
20210630 - 0065:   This one did not have MOT (RF 68)
20210630 - 0075:   RF=78, with nitrogen this is often a condensate (or very close)
20210630 - 0076:   RF=79 without Nitrogen
20210630 - 0077:   Just 6 pixels of atoms left at RF=80
20210630 - 0078:   At RF=81 its really gone
20210630 - 0080:   Yea, I dont know. MOT looks great but we just cant get enough particles. Lets stop for now and resume in August...
20210824 - 0014:   Ya boi
20210824 - 0041:   Nice combo, cond. frac. at ~30%
20210824 - 0042:   Empty
20210824 - 0043:   Empty
20210824 - 0044:   Empty - Cooling off too much?
20210824 - 0047:   Condensate, woo, at 61%
20210824 - 0138:   Empty
20210824 - 0139:   Empty - pushed the curves too far.
20210825 - 0006:   Camera messed up
20210825 - 0010:   Pulses messed up
20210826 - 0000:   Empty
20210826 - 0001:   Empty
20210826 - 0002:   
20210826 - 0003:   Empty
20210826 - 0025:   Empty
20210826 - 0033:   Nice cloud, with some condensate
20210826 - 0036:   Empty
20210826 - 0037:   Empty
20210826 - 0038:   Empty
20210826 - 0039:   Empty
20210826 - 0040:   Empty
20210826 - 0075:   Switched curve for RF2 to RF compres 2 that I made before summer. instantly works better!
20210826 - 0078:   >Hell yea, just put RF3 to 15 for the heck of it and its a decompressed condensate
20210826 - 0079:   Decompressed condensate
20210826 - 0093:   We lose about 9 million particles in decompression
20210826 - 0097:   RF3=14 but doesnt look too goeed
20210826 - 0103:   Small as well, but looks promising.
20210826 - 0104:   Small :(
20210826 - 0105:   Low particle number, not even a proper condensate
20210826 - 0130:   Nice nice
20210826 - 0132:   No tof
20210826 - 0143:   More like 90%
20210826 - 0145:   More like 90%
20210826 - 0153:   Yo!
20210826 - 0154:   0 tof
20210826 - 0162:   Pulses settings messed up
20210826 - 0163:   Pulses settings messed up
20210826 - 0164:   Last one, back to TI to make sure we still have it. We do.
20210827 - 0000:   Nice
20210827 - 0100:   This is without decompression, classic RF 81
20210827 - 0106:   Yeah, something, undecompressed, and small
20210827 - 0117:   Looks right! But a bit small, would hope for a bigger one.
20210827 - 0134:   Blah, fine. Monday time crystals, though!
20210830 - 0131:   These thold's are irrelevant - there was no thold parameter
20210830 - 0161:   Great particle number for cooled down. Let's now decompress.
20210830 - 0162:   Eyy :/
20210830 - 0163:   Losing particles in decompression
20210830 - 0173:   Again can't decompress.
20210830 - 0174:   Still nothing
20210830 - 0199:   Blah, nothing, empty
20210901 - 0009:   No clue what happened here
20210901 - 0011:   Climbing
20210901 - 0088:   Weird, theres some sort of shadow below it
20210901 - 0099:   Time crystal, I guess?
20210901 - 0100:   Time crystal
20210901 - 0101:   Yo Time crystal
20210901 - 0102:   Space crystal for sure
20210902 - 0049:   nicht ideal, aber es functioniert
20210902 - 0051:   Well... there is someting so that is nice
20210902 - 0052:   This is just not good enough to start condensing this... Problem might also be that were almost out of N2
20210902 - 0053:   Lets just run RF60 for a while and eat lunch
20210902 - 0073:   Increased N2 flow, but its almost empty
20210902 - 0079:   Maybe the low particle number was really n2 dependent?
20210902 - 0083:   Nitrogen pressure now drops quicly
20210902 - 0085:   Opening the N2 all the way doesnt make any difference, its run out :(
20210902 - 0088:   accidentally left on decompression at RF60, cool to see that its not empty
20210902 - 0089:   Lets just let it run like this, curious how stable decomp at RF 60 is
20210902 - 0094:   <tried with rf3 enabled at 5 seconds
20210902 - 0106:   Lets just disable this decompression
20210902 - 0198:   Empty
20210902 - 0199:   Empty
20210902 - 0200:   Empty
20210902 - 0201:   Empty
20210902 - 0202:   Empty
20210903 - 0014:   empty again...
20210903 - 0037:   ruined it by light
20210903 - 0043:   All empty
20210903 - 0044:   It is here, but 0 tof - but decompressed.
20210903 - 0049:   Empty, with RF3
20210903 - 0050:   Empty, with RF3
20210906 - 0028:   Interesting, at tof=15 we are nowhere close to condensation.. Maybe the RF2 curve was wrong all the time?
20210906 - 0050:   practically out of nitrogen, not sure if were gonna be able to condense
20210906 - 0053:   Well we have some condensates so that is nice
20210908 - 0030:   Ruined by checking nitrogen
20210908 - 0054:   Looks nice but it might nog be close enough to condensation
20210908 - 0056:   Try lowering RF2 18s from 2.5->2.42 Hz
20210908 - 0063:   Okay this is nice and should be closer to condensing... Lets try decompression soon
20210908 - 0065:   Okay, decompression works and we maintain roughly 20 mil particles. EPIC
20210908 - 0067:   Not good, it seems to decrease in particle number
20210908 - 0069:   :(
20210908 - 0077:   Again decreasing after several decomp runs
20210908 - 0082:   Weird, the fit failed
20210908 - 0083:   Lets try some RF3 after this
20210908 - 0084:   Ruined that one
20210908 - 0086:   As it settles into its RF3 curve it disappears :(
20210908 - 0087:   Okay maybe it just has to settle a bit more
20210908 - 0088:   Why is it like this????? :(
20210908 - 0090:   I think during this one the MT safety kicked in again
20210908 - 0091:   No MT safety, still empty
20210908 - 0104:   no mot
20210908 - 0123:   Going to low RF3's, check where we lose it.
20210908 - 0126:   Seems fine at 1
20210908 - 0131:   Starting to lose it here.
20210908 - 0139:   Lets alter the curve
20210908 - 0163:   Changed decomp to 0.5V, MT safety kicked in again at end of RF3, very strange
20210908 - 0164:   Safety didnt kick in but its still empty
20210908 - 0165:   Maybe we could talk to Dante about the safety thingy kicking in.
20210908 - 0209:   Okay, its coming back at RF3=12. Maybe its settling really slowly into the curve?
20210909 - 0001:   Lets get this party started. Might run out of LN2 halway through the day
20210909 - 0005:   Empty
20210909 - 0012:   The particle number doesnt seem to go up a lot, maybe check the powers (or LN2 might have to settle)
20210909 - 0013:   Weird, occasionally its just empty... maybe the MT safety?
20210909 - 0014:   Better
20210909 - 0019:   Empty again
20210909 - 0021:   Lets see RF2=18 for the next run
20210909 - 0022:   RF2=18, migth have to settle into its RF2 curve a bit
20210909 - 0023:   Not good enough particle number
20210909 - 0025:   Gonig to check the powers
20210909 - 0027:   Powers were fine, Zeeman:182 mW, Repump upgraded from 3.9->4.07 mW
20210909 - 0036:   Running out of LN2
20210909 - 0037:   Out of LN2, lets let that warm up
20210909 - 0087:   Switched nitrogen, ruined image
20210909 - 0098:   Neat particle number
20210909 - 0108:   Condensation in a compressed cloud, at RF18s on the RF compressed curve.
20210909 - 0133:   ^ I like that!
20210909 - 0134:   Looks like decompressed condensates are coming back to town baby
20210909 - 0136:   ^ I don't like that
20210909 - 0137:   Damn it disappeared
20210909 - 0138:   Its small but its there 2.5 million condensed particles
20210909 - 0139:   Lets optimize that curve towards 90% condensation
20210909 - 0145:   Empty, maybe MT safety?
20210909 - 0146:   Empty
20210909 - 0147:   Empty
20210909 - 0148:   Okay, disabling kick got it back, nice!
20210909 - 0150:   The bimodal fit is failing a bit
20210909 - 0151:   It seems a bit tilted... scissor mode? Vary thold a bit to see if Faraday waves appear
20210909 - 0153:   At thold=0.5 the tilt changed, probably scissor mode. Go to higher TOF to find Faraday waves
20210909 - 0154:   Empty
20210909 - 0161:   Good, its back at a condensation fraction of 100%
20210909 - 0164:   Seem nothing
20210909 - 0168:   Started varying thold 1.0->2.0 steps of 0.1
20210909 - 0170:   Looks like a Time Crystal
20210909 - 0178:   End of varying thold
20210909 - 0179:   TC
20210909 - 0180:   Deeper kick 4V->3.85V. Thats a Time Crystal YOOOO
20210909 - 0181:   TC
20210909 - 0182:   mini TC
20210909 - 0183:   Real funky
20210909 - 0184:   Time Crystal, but still at 3.90 trap depth.
20210909 - 0185:   At a deeper kick of 4.0->3.8 its gone again.
20210909 - 0186:   Same as before, small but almost not there.
20210909 - 0187:   Still with the 3.8 - A bit too much, it appears.
20210909 - 0188:   Still at 3.8, let's go to just 4 (so no kick) to see if there is anything there.
20210909 - 0189:   No kick, no TC.
20210909 - 0190:   No kick, it seems 'normal' no TC here
20210909 - 0192:   TC here, back to kick. But it might be a bit too strong, we want to excite no other modes.
20210909 - 0199:   50 ms later --> scissor mode indeed. But also less of a TC (or just in that mode)
20210909 - 0200:   Same, no TC? Or just in that regime. If so, then we should see it at 1.3 thold. Not necessarly, if TC is at 50 Hz, then every 0.02s
20210909 - 0201:   Let's go to 1.3 thold.
20210909 - 0202:   Hmm. Empty
20210909 - 0203:   Back!
20210909 - 0204:   Hm, cool. Might be interesting to try and loop it.
20210909 - 0205:   Empty, why - the kick is fine
20210909 - 0206:   Nice, this is @ 0 tof. Can't really see any time-crystalline behaviour. But I trust it's there.
20210909 - 0207:   beauty
20210909 - 0210:   I think we've got time to run a list.
20210909 - 0211:   Also, let's see when the TC appears.
20210909 - 0212:   Empty. Low thold.
20210909 - 0213:   Here already having the TC
20210909 - 0215:   Interestingly, no TC here. Not enough time to appear? Orjust in the regime?
20210909 - 0216:   No
20210909 - 0217:   No
20210909 - 0218:   Uf yeah here. Quite wild.
20210909 - 0219:   No
20210909 - 0220:   Yeah a bit. Might be around here where it appears.
20210909 - 0222:   Let's run a list, thold between 0.5 and 0.65 - maybe we can get something out of it.
20210910 - 0003:   MOT didnt look too good so I relocked repump laser (wasnt locked to its peak optimally)
20210910 - 0005:   Lets let this run and settle for a while
20210910 - 0021:   Decent particle number, try RF2=16
20210910 - 0023:   Empty at RF2=16 :(
20210910 - 0030:   Particle number is a bit low, maybe optimize the powers a bit
20210910 - 0039:   A condensate, lets find out when were right before it
20210910 - 0043:   At RF2=18s we are right before condensation
20210910 - 0055:   Losing it at RF3=15 :(
20210910 - 0068:   Running out of LN2
20210910 - 0072:   Quite a nice particle number. Lets see how that decreases as the LN2 warms up over lunch
20210910 - 0074:   360 million particles, nice!
20210910 - 0125:   Switched LN2 after this run, lets see the particle number climb again (I hope)
20210910 - 0153:   A bit of condensate at RF2=17
20210910 - 0163:   condensate
20210910 - 0171:   Empty :(
20210910 - 0172:   From here on everything is empty
20210910 - 0174:   Also empty, no kick and RF3=22 :(
20210910 - 0177:   Looks as if there was an MT overload, lets keep an eye on that for a while
20210910 - 0178:   On cloverleaf box a red light blinked right before TOF and right after TOF
20210910 - 0179:   DC fail blinks right before TOF
20210910 - 0180:   It also blinks before Compress MT so maybe its meant to happen
20210910 - 0181:   Its meant to blink
20210910 - 0187:   Empty
20210910 - 0199:   Its messing with me, disappearing at 14s and reappearing at 17
20210910 - 0201:   Finally I got some condensates back
20210910 - 0209:   Scissor mode is present
20210910 - 0211:   I think thats a Time Crystal
20210910 - 0212:   lets start building a sequence for OAH multiple imgs
20210910 - 0214:   Camera test, 3 frames
20210910 - 0215:   Its there, at 0 tof its very small
20210910 - 0222:   Trying to open camera further is unsuccesful so far. Condensate nowhere to be found unfortunately
20210910 - 0224:   Tried to set camera back, didnt work. Lets stop for today
20210913 - 0000:   Forgot to set the camera properly again after friday, oops
20210913 - 0002:   LN2 probably has to settle a bit
20210913 - 0006:   Yeet yoot, the particle number is quite good
20210913 - 0009:   RF2=17, not good but it might just have to settle a bit
20210913 - 0011:   lets first explore the RF Compressed curve
20210913 - 0014:   Its not behaving well today
20210913 - 0015:   Empty
20210913 - 0018:   We'd want some more particles, think it might be due to the LN2
20210913 - 0021:   It might be worth checking the powers as well
20210913 - 0023:   Powers were mostly fined. Zeeman=181, repump 3.9->4.3
20210913 - 0028:   The MOT is "breathing" again, might want to check that
20210913 - 0033:   hmmm, why cant we get a higher particle number?
20210913 - 0046:   Condensate at RF2 compressed = 19s. See where that curve is right before condensing
20210913 - 0048:   At 18s RF2 we also have this tiny condensate
20210913 - 0050:   At RF2=17 we dont have condensate.
20210913 - 0057:   Quite small unfortunately already at RF3=15
20210913 - 0060:   Decompressed condensate
20210913 - 0066:   Out of LN2, let let it run over lunch and see when we lose the condensate
20210913 - 0067:   
20210913 - 0172:   
20210913 - 0173:

20210913 - 0182:   
20210913 - 0183:   
20210914 - 0001:   Lets leave it to settle a bit more
20210914 - 0110:   The LN2 is getting flowing
20210914 - 0135:   Tried kicking it but now its empty
20210914 - 0141:   kickdepth 3.95, scissor mode seems present
20210914 - 0148:   We are taking 10 images with a 3.9V kick. Lets let this run over lunch and go to HI afterwards
20210914 - 0156:   Tried a symmetric kick but that doesnt seem to work that well
20210914 - 0157:   With the regular downward kick it works again, next try with a symmetric kick of depth 0.05V
20210914 - 0158:   With a symmetric kick it disappears a lot faster, but its there!
20210914 - 0164:   There is something there at RF3=20
20210914 - 0191:   I mean it's there but very faint
20210914 - 0192:   No decompression. gives much better results - well, better SNR
20210914 - 0193:   Same
20210914 - 0217:   
20210914 - 0218:   
20210914 - 0219:   
20210914 - 0220:   
20210914 - 0221:   
20210916 - 0002:   Having some start up troubles but lets let it settle for a while
20210916 - 0014:   How's nitrogen?
20210916 - 0021:   Tried some RF2=19, quite empty unfortunately
20210916 - 0025:   When we get close to condensing it disappears, maybe LN2 has to settle?
20210916 - 0040:   Condensate at RF2=18
20210916 - 0044:   Empty when trying decomp. have to switch curve first

20210916 - 0176:   Also a condensate at RF2=17
20210916 - 0178:   This is difficult to say at RF2=16, maybe its a really tiny condensate?
20210916 - 0180:   Thats definitly a condensate, go down to RF2=15

20210916 - 0228:   
20210916 - 0229:   Lets lower the curve a bit
20210916 - 0230:   
20210916 - 0231:   A little bit of decompressed condensate at  lowered RF3=18, nice
20210916 - 0232:   
20210916 - 0233:   Accidentally made RF2 19 instead of RF3 but fortunatley that didnt ruin it
20210916 - 0234:   
20210916 - 0235:   Thats odd, at RF3=19 there seems to be less condensate

20210917 - 0020:   Not the right number, ruined by light
20210921 - 0005:   This is quite a bad particle number, even without LN2
20210921 - 0011:   The MT is going wild during Rf60
20210921 - 0016:   Troubleshooting here on up.
20210922 - 0005:   Maybe just let it run for a little bit, it still has to recover from its trauma yesterday
20210922 - 0022:   This is a horrible particle number...
20210922 - 0024:   Just started LN2, although this number should be baseline without LN2
20210922 - 0041:   Dit is niet genoeg om fatsoenlijk te decompen en te condenseren. Het moet echt beter @RF60
20210922 - 0042:   Tiny condensate @RF80
20210922 - 0044:   Looks like its setteling into the curve
20210922 - 0053:   Seems empty but tof was 23
20210922 - 0058:   This slowly goes towards the values I want
20210922 - 0113:   scissor mode after 3.9V kick (not symmetricf)
20210922 - 0125:   Is this a time crystal????!
20210922 - 0128:   kick 4.0->3.9 V
20210922 - 0132:   This could very well be a time crystal!! Symmetric kick
20210922 - 0133:   Stronger kick, maybe a bit too severe?
20210922 - 0140:   Empty with a stronger kick
20210922 - 0141:   now its back
20210922 - 0142:   empty
20210922 - 0145:   LN2 pressure dropping fast
20210923 - 0004:   Something about MOT was off, tried relocking
20210923 - 0006:   empty
20210923 - 0014:   Why is this empty?? Its very unstable
20210923 - 0020:   Not enough particles :(
20210923 - 0030:   Why is it decreasing? :(
20210923 - 0033:   ruined by light
20210923 - 0035:   Lets maybe check the powers
20210923 - 0045:   Its just not getting any higher :(
20210923 - 0052:   Guess we should optimize Zeeman mirror or something, this is not going to work
20210923 - 0060:   What is up here... does spinpol not work occasionally?
20210923 - 0108:   tiny condensate at RF2=18
20210923 - 0126:   This is a time crystal (I quite certainly think!)
20210923 - 0127:   higher TOF, pretty sure its still a TC though
20210923 - 0129:   TOF 10, too optically dense?
20210923 - 0131:   I feel liket his is a TC
20210923 - 0135:   empty:(
20210923 - 0138:   Stronger kick, very tiny
20210923 - 0146:   Time crystal is back with a slightly stronger and repeated kick
20210923 - 0161:   Thats a t.c. with jaspers kick
20210923 - 0164:   TC
20210923 - 0165:   tc
20210923 - 0169:   Damn, forgot to set camera
20210923 - 0174:   tc
20210923 - 0175:   Also tc but this kick was to 3.85 not 3.84
20210923 - 0176:   tc
20210923 - 0192:   Kick down to 3.9V, stil brighter at bottom of dipole mode
20210923 - 0194:   Not sure if this is still a TC
20210923 - 0195:   Symmetric kick of depth 0.1V, much less dipole mode
20210923 - 0198:   More intense symetrick kick with depth 0.12V. Not sure if its still a TC
20210923 - 0201:   Jaspers non symmetric kick, depth 3.85
20210923 - 0202:   Symmetric kick again
20210923 - 0204:   This one is good!
20210923 - 0205:   With a stronger symmetric kick  of 1.5V its disappearing
20210923 - 0207:   Less intense symmetric kick, 0.12V
20210924 - 0099:   TC?
20210924 - 0111:   With Jaspers double kick we get a time crystal
20210924 - 0112:   Geen bergkristal maar tijdkristal
20210924 - 0113:   Out of LN2 :(
Makes no sense to go to off axis then for today
20210924 - 0118:   out of lN2
20210927 - 0002:   The probe beam is also a bit messy
20210927 - 0006:   empty
20210927 - 0009:   empty
20210927 - 0117:   TOF, MT disabled during imaging
20210927 - 0118:   With TOF but MT back on during imaging. Almost the same as if we had TOF
20210927 - 0119:   With TOF but MT back on during imaging.5 images. There is some strange movement
20210927 - 0131:   Thats quite a nice time crystal
20210928 - 0003:   Empty probably laser drift
20210928 - 0015:   Particle number is nice today
20210930 - 0000:   MT was wild again during RF1
20211006 - 0000:   Mostly today for the sake of checking the coils.
20211006 - 0025:   Coils seem to work fine, but the laser drifted away here.
20211006 - 0026:   Now we're talking
20211006 - 0039:   More like it.
20211006 - 0045:   Let's try 78 seconds cooling
20211006 - 0047:   78 + decomp + 23
20211006 - 0049:   78 + decomp
20211006 - 0050:   ...
20211006 - 0053:   ...
20211006 - 0054:   ...
20211006 - 0055:   78 + decomp + 23 + kick
20211006 - 0056:   ...
20211006 - 0057:   ...
20211006 - 0102:   But no crystal. Let's increase the kick depth
20211006 - 0104:   Crystalie
20211007 - 0012:   Relocking lazers
20211007 - 0013:   Relocking lazers
20211007 - 0015:   300 million, nice
20211007 - 0037:   Empty
20211007 - 0038:   No MOT
20211007 - 0042:   Zeeman: 188 mW
Repump: 4.0 -> 4.3 mW
20211007 - 0088:   Nice
20211007 - 0091:   Decomp RF3=0
20211007 - 0100:   Out of LN2, just run at RF60 a bit before switching
20211008 - 0012:   empty
20211008 - 0028:   LN2 kicks in
20211008 - 0032:   I dont think this is goig to work as fast as I want for today. Lets stop it now and work on simulation/thesis a bit more
20211011 - 0073:   Thats what Im talking about
20211011 - 0084:   With a kick, might have to settle into it...
20211014 - 0003:   Still on old camera settings, and HI detuning. Should be fine after this.
20211015 - 0082:   Time crystal
20211015 - 0083:   time crystal
20211015 - 0084:   I think its a time crystal but im not sure
20211015 - 0086:   Time crystal
20211015 - 0087:   Time crystal
20211015 - 0094:   Time crystal, good.
20211015 - 0095:   A crystal made of time
20211015 - 0097:   Empty?
20211015 - 0098:   Also empty, go back to TI
20211015 - 0099:   Left power meter in
20211015 - 0100:   Empty
20211015 - 0101:   Somehow I lost most of the atoms at RF60....
20211015 - 0102:   Probe: 60 muW
Repump: 4.5 mW
Zeeman: 178 mW
Also LN2 seems fine. Why did it suddenly break down???
20211015 - 0103:   And now we seem back in business...
20211015 - 0112:   Pfieuw, I got it back
20211015 - 0116:   Lets try OAH one more time
20211018 - 0012:   Crancked up the power of the probe beam to ~0.7mW
20211018 - 0013:   Too much power?
20211018 - 0020:   Ignore this.
20211018 - 0063:   This is horrible for RF60
20211018 - 0064:   we are very  much out of LN2, lets just leave it running while that warms up
20211018 - 0110:   switched LN2, lets see that particle number climb
20211020 - 0030:   All empty, we were mostly checking cooling tubes. No MOT though.
20211101 - 0040:   Ignore all those below. Was troubleshooting and test runs. Finally, got it to work. I hope.
20211102 - 0001:   I guess there is something here
20211102 - 0004:   Also the fingerprint like spot has shifted along with the cloud
20211102 - 0010:   Powers are fine but the particle number isnt that good
20211102 - 0019:   tof=0, the cloud is making a slight angle
20211102 - 0025:   RF=70
20211102 - 0030:   With RF compressed curve for 18s down to 2.42 Hz we get a tiny condensate again. Seems the curves are still working fine then
20211102 - 0031:   Now its gone but were probably going to need more particles for the curves to work as they used to. I need at least 280 million at RF60
20211102 - 0033:   We can make condensates but we have to optimise the particle number to decomp again
20211102 - 0036:   This is going towards the right particle numbers!
20211102 - 0040:   Particle number seems to fluctuate a bit? Let it run for a bit
20211102 - 0041:   Let it run for a bit
20211102 - 0048:   Decomp, RF3=0
20211102 - 0053:   Thats a decompressed condensate
20211102 - 0069:   Time crystal, kick 3.83V RF3=23, tof=17 thold=0.7
20211102 - 0072:   Losing it
20211102 - 0074:   Particle number isnt that great
20211102 - 0079:   Empty
20211102 - 0096:   Other reference beam..
20211102 - 0097:   Images of only the reference beam
20211102 - 0099:   Other reference beam, no interference
20211102 - 0105:   back to TI
20211103 - 0064:   TOF too low, too optically dense. RF2=18
20211103 - 0075:   This might be a good enough condensation fraction to troubleshoot OAH
20211103 - 0093:   Great set, looks like some very nice time crystals. But this is without a kick??
20211103 - 0165:   WHat's going on with the interference here? The angle seems to shift a bit? Between shots in general.
20211108 - 0006:   Empty because no curent in the MT coils. Should work now.
20211108 - 0022:   
20211108 - 0023:   
20211108 - 0024:   
20211108 - 0025:   
20211108 - 0026:   
20211108 - 0040:   Strech, just before transition it seems
20211108 - 0041:   Turns out all of those had a kick in it. Hopefully it shouldn't perturb it too much.
20211108 - 0042:   Nice.
20211108 - 0044:   Tilted, with some axial mode
20211108 - 0064:   Maybe too much cooling?
20211108 - 0068:   All Empty
20211108 - 0071:   Cloud
20211108 - 0072:   C
20211108 - 0073:   C
20211108 - 0085:   Axial modes
20211108 - 0086:   C
20211108 - 0089:   The problem is, not sure if we have a condensate here.
20211108 - 0095:   Let's try to kick it harder.
20211109 - 0027:   Zeeman power very low, could get it to 150 mW but certainly not to 180
20211109 - 0039:   Probably forgot to switch the RF curve
20211109 - 0043:   empty
20211109 - 0054:   Decomp + RF3 doesnt seem to work anymore :(
20211109 - 0065:   RF3=17, right before condensation?
20211109 - 0087:   T.C. finally
20211109 - 0093:   With kick, time crystal
20211109 - 0099:   Its not in this image range
20211109 - 0105:   Not good
20211109 - 0106:   This has to be a time crystal right??!
20211109 - 0110:   RF3=22, cooling too much
20211109 - 0112:   This one is great!!
20211109 - 0113:   Img group 4 enabled, images analysis doesnt work properly I think
20211109 - 0114:   1 second waiting time
20211109 - 0124:   Bad interference but the condensate is there
20211109 - 0125:   Good interfernce
20211109 - 0129:   Lost inerference
20211109 - 0130:   Bad interference
20211109 - 0131:   This is better
20211109 - 0132:   Huge gradient in interference, RF3=20 ipv 21
20211109 - 0142:   Img loop 4 enabled. Why are there NANs in the interference?
20211109 - 0143:   The analysis just doesnt work properly
20211109 - 0164:   RF3=19, more thermal cloud
20211109 - 0170:   RF3=18s much more thermal cloud
20211109 - 0172:   small MOT
20211109 - 0182:   RF=21
20211109 - 0183:   kick, RF3=21
20211109 - 0185:   back to TI, looks good!
20211110 - 0004:   Checking if we see a nice cloud for flourescent imaging
20211110 - 0006:   Looks good I think
20211110 - 0008:   Empty ones for zeeman
20211110 - 0082:   Cloud here
20211110 - 0083:   And here, but then it dissapears
20211110 - 0084:   Seems like some pulse issue with the tof
20211117 - 0018:   Fluorescent imaging
20211117 - 0021:   Can see the laser ?
20211117 - 0023:   Lower tof, it seems we are just shooting a hole in the cloude
20211117 - 0025:   Funky, definetely hitting the cloud
20211117 - 0055:   Funky, this is with a decompression, and we are still hitting the cloud. I think from the linecut it seems like we are not exactly hitting the cloud perfectly centrally.
20211117 - 0057:   With no tof - cannot see anytthing
20211117 - 0066:   Condensed already, with 60 + 20 + 23
20211117 - 0067:   Condensed with some thermal cloud, with 60 + 18 + 20
20211117 - 0076:   2 turn power dial. 60 seconds cooling, no effect.
20211117 - 0099:   with decompression and rf3 - looks promising
20211117 - 0100:   Double dipole trap, what is going on? Or just the ring around it somehow?
20211117 - 0106:   Starting to see something in the middle
20211117 - 0118:   condensate, not sure if hitting it with a laser
20211124 - 0023:   Camera not on
20211124 - 0042:   Odd, can't seem to get it back to ~280M like before

20211126 - 0034:   great
20211126 - 0038:   With laser on. Lower particle numbers
20211126 - 0039:   No laser can be seen
20211126 - 0085:   old decompression curve, but its already a tiny condensate at rf3=18
20211126 - 0098:   kick obviously induced a scissor mode
20211126 - 0099:   Axial mode visible
20211126 - 0105:   No kick, no axial mode. Thats good right. That's good.
20211126 - 0108:   kick, axial mode
20211126 - 0110:   No kick yet there is some axial mode it seems...
20211126 - 0112:   thold just fully disabled
20211126 - 0113:   Very nice
20211126 - 0115:   This one is definitely moving while im not kicking it...
20211126 - 0118:   
20211129 - 0000:   Fluorescent Imaging
20211130 - 0013:   This is still at 60 seconds cooling
20211130 - 0014:   Yes, beauty. Seems a bit out of focus, though.
20211130 - 0036:   Woah
20211130 - 0041:   With decompression
20211130 - 0051:   Great stuff!
20211130 - 0054:   As centered as we had it
20211130 - 0057:   Gooood. Looks great this.
20211130 - 0074:   When shifting focus too much, we just lose it?
20211130 - 0078:   Particle number seems low, maybe because of N2?
20211201 - 0010:   These particle numbers are lower - could it be becuase we have about a second of thold time, due to the (empty) IR laser channel?
20211201 - 0011:   Seems a bit higher indeed, but not close to 500 M we had previous days.
20211201 - 0061:   As expected at tof 0
20211201 - 0062:   Empty at 18, of course
20211201 - 0063:   tof 4
20211201 - 0064:   tof IR 3
20211201 - 0065:   At tof 6
20211201 - 0066:   Still at 9
20211201 - 0067:   Still see it at 8 ms
20211201 - 0068:   At 1 ms IR tof we do see the expansion
20211201 - 0074:   
20211201 - 0075:   Let's try with some extra RF cooling, check for condensates.
20211201 - 0076:   Still things here, let's try to check condensates?
20211201 - 0077:   The problem here is of coruse that we put in some energy with the transfer, so we should do the final stages of cooling in the ODT.
20211201 - 0083:   At tof=2 normal expension of thermal cloud
20211201 - 0086:   With BEC worth of cooling - let's see in tof if this is anywhere near a condensate, but it doesn't seem like it. 
We will need to do the final stages of cooling in the dipole trap.
20211201 - 0103:   IR at 7 cyc power
20211201 - 0104:   IR at 6 cyc
20211201 - 0105:   IR at 5 cyc
20211201 - 0106:   IR at 4 cyc
20211201 - 0110:   out of N2 & IR off
20220106 - 0006:   Now using the manual AOM amp scale - but perhaps here the output is too low? Not sure to what values we should go, voltage wise. This is at 1.5 V. Although Jasper went to 1 V only.
20220106 - 0007:   Something is showing here! at 1.8 V. Maybe a bit more? Jasper did warn me though to not over-voltage it. But it does say on the card-kast the limit to be at 2.5? Maybe. I hope so haha.
20220106 - 0008:   Still not quite. This is at 2 V. Let's try 2.4 V next one.
20220106 - 0009:   At 2.4 V Def more, but not there yet? :S
20220106 - 0010:   2.5 V
20220106 - 0011:   Lemme just try to increase the IR power, and then I can keep at 1 V or whatever.
20220106 - 0013:   At 9.5 turns - much better, but still, can we do better, maybe?
20220106 - 0014:   Alright alright alright
20220106 - 0015:   Boyyyyyy would you look at that!
20220106 - 0016:   Lowered the trap depth to 1.8, and it looks good still.
20220106 - 0018:   1.6 V trap depth. We might need some TOF to check how well we are doing.
20220106 - 0021:   IR tof 10 ms, but I might have disabled the channel.
20220106 - 0022:   Yep, IR TOF channel was off.
20220106 - 0023:   Better. at 5 ms IR tof, 1.6 V trap depth. Try again with higher (lower) trap depth, 1.8 V
20220106 - 0024:   1.8 Trap depth
20220106 - 0025:   1.0 V Trap depth
20220106 - 0026:   1.0 V trap dedpth
20220106 - 0027:   0.8 V trap depth - Are we sure we are still trapping with IR? Let's do one without.
20220106 - 0028:   0.6 trap depth
20220106 - 0029:   This is no IR and we see similar cloud :/
20220106 - 0030:   
20220106 - 0031:   With 50 ms tof for magnetic trap, and 0 for IR.
20220106 - 0032:   IRTOF = 1
20220106 - 0033:   2 ms tof at 1.8 V
20220106 - 0034:   Seems a bit more compressed.
20220106 - 0035:   Even more compressed at 1.2 V. How do we explain this? - more condensed?
20220106 - 0036:   At 1.0 V even more
20220106 - 0037:   0.8 V
20220106 - 0038:   0.6 V
20220106 - 0039:   0.4 V - wider, but fainter.
20220106 - 0040:   Empty. Nice, so that is too low. at 0.2 trap depth.
20220106 - 0041:   
20220106 - 0042:   
20220106 - 0043:   
20220106 - 0044:   
20220106 - 0045:   
20220106 - 0046:   
20220106 - 0047:   
20220106 - 0048:   Gaussian fits will probably not work too well as we don't know the trapping frequencies, but just as a rough indicator.
20220106 - 0049:   
20220106 - 0050:   
20220106 - 0051:   
20220106 - 0052:   
20220106 - 0053:   These runs are at different initial depths. Trying to see what works best.
20220106 - 0054:   More or less all the same
20220106 - 0055:   
20220106 - 0056:   IR duration = 0 means no IR at all? I guess.
20220106 - 0057:   It looks like a little condeensate in the middle.
20220106 - 0058:   
20220106 - 0059:   
20220106 - 0060:   It is also likely we are out of LN2
20220106 - 0061:   
20220106 - 0062:   
20220106 - 0063:   
20220106 - 0064:   
20220106 - 0065:   With coils off after the IR laser comes on
20220106 - 0066:   
20220106 - 0067:   
20220106 - 0068:   
20220106 - 0070:   
20220106 - 0071:   
20220106 - 0072:   
20220106 - 0073:   
20220106 - 0074:   
20220106 - 0079:   with the curve, but no tof
20220106 - 0080:   Now we're talking. This looks like a condensate. Hihger condensate fraction than before, because we lowered the trap depth.
20220106 - 0081:   Same, but faster ramp, doesn't seem to make a difference.
20220106 - 0086:   Well well well
20220106 - 0088:   My light
20220106 - 0092:   No RF3 cooling. Very dispersed. My guess is too much IR TOF
20220106 - 0093:   Empty. Or maybe trap not high enough to trap -> And we are loosing them in the MT tof? Let's raise the ramp time and the depth of the trap.
20220106 - 0094:   Something there, but maybe not deep enough? Let's try without the cooling ramp at the end.
20220106 - 0097:   Looks good, back at the whole sequence. Let's see what just holding the atoms in the IR trap does - odttime at 8 seconds, but no curve cooling (next one).
20220106 - 0098:   Still there after 8 seconds, no cooling, just hold time.
20220106 - 0100:   Quite a big cloud - this is with MT on during first stages of ODT
20220106 - 0101:   Let's try the sume but with the MT off after we introduce the IR
20220106 - 0103:   Higher initial trap depth, and this looks much better. But it doesn't seem condensed.
20220106 - 0109:   Good, 7 s cooling. It seems a bit small though
20220106 - 0110:   Neat, at 6 seconds of cooling. Of that one curve lol
20220106 - 0117:   At 10 ms tof - looks like a condensate to me
20220110 - 0004:   Blank, I assume because of the pretrig channel too short.
20220110 - 0007:   Nice
20220110 - 0016:   
20220110 - 0017:   Bimodal fits dont seem to work for some reason
20220110 - 0021:   Condensed nicely
20220110 - 0043:   Strangeeee, higher order axial modes maybe?
20220110 - 0046:   Just trying to optimize the decompression now
20220110 - 0048:   Decompressed to 0.5 V
20220110 - 0049:   Decompressed to 0.5 V
20220110 - 0050:   Decompressed to 0.4 V
20220110 - 0051:   Decompressed to 0.35 V
20220110 - 0052:   Decompressed to 0.3 V
20220110 - 0053:   Decompressed to 0.2 V
20220110 - 0054:   Decompressed to 0.2 V
20220110 - 0055:   Decompressed to 0.15 V
20220110 - 0056:   Decompressed to 0.15 V
20220110 - 0057:   Decompressed to 0.1 V
20220110 - 0058:   Decompressed to 0.1 V
20220110 - 0059:   No tof - decom to 0.1 V. Let's go even lower and then try to hit it with the laser.
20220110 - 0060:   Wild. Decompressed to 0.05 V, but seems that we are loosing particles here. Or just the fit?
20220110 - 0061:   Decompressed to 0.05 V
20220110 - 0062:   Pretty decompressed
20220110 - 0063:   Could we decompress further? I guess similarly tilted as the ODT?
20220110 - 0064:   Decompressed to 0.01 + 5 ms of tof
20220110 - 0065:   Still looks promising
20220110 - 0067:   This still looks okay, and this is the lowest we can go with decreasing the gradient current.
20220110 - 0068:   Let's have a look with some RF3 time as well. But for now, this looks promising, ish?
20220110 - 0069:   With RF3 time now. Previous without. Wild.
20220110 - 0070:   WIth tof now. Number of particles still good.
20220110 - 0071:   With tof. How are these numbers so high?  Let's try more cooling
20220110 - 0072:   Let's check how it looks at 0 tof. Is maybe the old cooling curve just not effective at this value?
20220110 - 0073:   At no tof. Let's check now at old BEC values, RF cooling of 21 seconds, without and then with tof.
20220110 - 0074:   Let's check this as well in expansion.
20220110 - 0078:   Condensate here. Let's see where we loose it, and bam it with the laser there.
20220110 - 0079:   Condensate here.
20220110 - 0080:   No condensate here
20220110 - 0081:   No condensate here
20220110 - 0082:   Some condensate here. Let's keep it at 15.
20220110 - 0083:   Some here as well.
20220110 - 0084:   At 15 s RF3, no condensation. Let' s now blast it with IR
20220110 - 0085:   No tof, but the center of the ODT seems to not be aligned with the MT
20220110 - 0086:   Without tof. Let's try with
20220110 - 0117:   Those runs speak for itself, we are clearly loosing particles past 1, 2 s.
20220110 - 0120:   Let's now check how the ramp speed affects it.
20220110 - 0133:   Trying different values, trying to shift the center of the trap.
20220110 - 0143:   Does not work, we have to shift the MOT values
20220110 - 0144:   Yeahhh this seems to work wonderfully. MOT value ramped from 0.53 to 0.6, over the same 20 seconds. Don't let the particle number fool you, we are using different trapping frequencies.
20220110 - 0146:   Looks decent, but small. :/
20220110 - 0147:   Seems small :/
20220110 - 0151:   Let's try first normal cooling and then move the MT. It seems like we are loosing a lot of particles cooling after moving it.
20220110 - 0152:   Maybe moved too violently? Let's try slower.
20220110 - 0155:   Seems like moving after cooling doesn't quite work.
20220111 - 0001:   Empty
20220111 - 0007:   A different script - works. Let's see what the issue is.
20220111 - 0011:   Back to old script, back to empty.
20220111 - 0012:   Still empty, what the hell.
20220111 - 0015:   HUH! ?
20220111 - 0050:   Had to reinstate the old cooling curves, but decomp seems fine
20220111 - 0051:   15 s of RF 3
20220111 - 0063:   Moved, and the particle number seems fine still.
20220111 - 0078:   Looks decent, yep. With decompression, with moving the cloud, followed by IR and then IR tof. IR depth at 0.6 V. Quick ramp in 2 seconds, no other cooling.
20220111 - 0093:   Those percentages do not seem right.
20220112 - 0009:   Great particle numbers!  Let's check after 78 s
20220112 - 0011:   Seems pretty good.
20220112 - 0014:   IR depth at 0, so nothing
20220112 - 0015:   Condensate, but still a decent portion of thermal cloud as well.
20220112 - 0018:   I want to see the difference if I decrease the amount of RF3 time.
20220112 - 0020:   Less RF3, less condensate it seems.
20220112 - 0024:   Cool cool. Let's also try to raise the trap level while also having less cooling. And then also the other way around.
20220112 - 0025:   Less condensate.
20220112 - 0053:   Last one with something, then all empty.
20220112 - 0076:   Pretty condensed
20220112 - 0080:   The axial mode is back though. Hmm.
20220112 - 0082:   Lower tof, to check if the axial mode is as pronounced here.
20220112 - 0085:   I am turning on the magnetic fields when imaging, let's just try to see if that does anything.
20220112 - 0086:   Same same. Nice.
20220112 - 0087:   Same trap depth, longer cooling time.
20220112 - 0088:   Longer cooling time with deeper trap depth.
20220112 - 0110:   Back at this. Let's explore this more, to understand what is going on. We might be aligning some magnetic field and separate spns states ?
20220112 - 0111:   Just for fun, let's try to apply the stern gerlach thing to see what happens
20220112 - 0116:   This is with the MOT switch
20220112 - 0119:   Turning the comp coils off during the hold.
20220112 - 0121:   Comp coils off - no axial mode
20220112 - 0122:   Comp off, but still this mode.
20220113 - 0002:   A bit low on the particle number,m ight be worth checking the powers. Oh wait, I know the issue. Tof was set wrongly
20220113 - 0013:   More ramp time, less odttime - looks better.
20220113 - 0049:   Without spinflip.
20220113 - 0050:   Without spinflip.
20220113 - 0051:   Without spinflip.
20220113 - 0052:   With spinflip = V = 100 mV
20220113 - 0053:   With spinflip = V = 100 mV - seems a bit less on average.
20220113 - 0054:   With spinflip = V = 200 mV
20220113 - 0055:   With spinflip = V = 200 mV
20220113 - 0056:   With spinflip = V = 300 mV
20220113 - 0057:   With spinflip = V = 300 mV
20220113 - 0058:   With spinflip = V = 400 mV
20220113 - 0059:   With spinflip = V = 400 mV
20220113 - 0060:   With spinflip = V = 500 mV - doesn't seem to affect it much
20220113 - 0061:   With spinflip = V = 500 mV
20220113 - 0062:   With spinflip = V = 600 mV
20220113 - 0063:   With spinflip = V = 600 mV
20220113 - 0064:   With spinflip = V = 700 mV
20220113 - 0069:   IR on, with spin flip
20220113 - 0070:   IR, no spin flip
20220113 - 0071:   
20220113 - 0076:   SG 5 ms, 100 mV, spin flip off?
20220113 - 0077:   SG 24 ms, 100 mV
20220113 - 0078:   SG 24 ms, 500 mV, 50 ms flip
20220113 - 0079:   300 mV flipping, 50 ms
20220113 - 0080:   300 mV, 50 ms flip
20220113 - 0081:   No trapping
20220113 - 0082:   No trapping
20220113 - 0083:   300 mV, 20 ms flip
20220113 - 0084:   300 mV, 20 ms flip
20220113 - 0085:   300 mV, 20 ms flip
20220113 - 0086:   300 mV, 5 ms flip
20220113 - 0087:   No flipping
20220113 - 0088:   No flipping
20220113 - 0089:   No SG, no flipping
20220113 - 0093:   SG on to 2V
20220113 - 0094:   SG on to 1V
20220113 - 0095:   lower tof
20220113 - 0096:   MOT switch on for SG (1V). 20 ms, 300 mV flip
20220113 - 0097:   SG (1.5V), 500 mV, 3 ms flip
20220113 - 0098:   700 mV, 3 ms flip
20220113 - 0099:   200 mV, 3 ms flip
20220114 - 0029:   
20220114 - 0030:   Until this one, all with spin flip. Let's try without spinflip to see if there is any difference - everythng else the same.
20220114 - 0031:   No spinflip
20220114 - 0035:   Let's schedule a list of 0 to 25 ms of tof
20220114 - 0041:   empty
20220114 - 0042:   empty
20220114 - 0043:   empty
20220114 - 0044:   empty
20220114 - 0045:   Try again - lasers got unlocked.
20220114 - 0047:   Moved by a different amount, and the stripy pattern more pronounced on one side only.
20220114 - 0048:   Empty again, lasers
20220114 - 0056:   This seems shifted, for sure, does that mean this is the other spin species?
20220114 - 0065:   no spinflipping, seems to constantly be at this location.
20220114 - 0066:   no spinflipping, seems to constantly be at this location.
20220114 - 0067:   no spinflipping, seems to constantly be at this location.
20220114 - 0068:   no spinflipping, seems to constantly be at this location.
20220114 - 0069:   no spinflipping, seems to constantly be at this location. Let's turn on spinflip.
20220114 - 0071:   Same location. Let's try stronger RF
20220114 - 0072:   Same same. At 400 mV
20220114 - 0073:   400 mV - but the spinfilp channel was 5 ms, while the sweep was programmed to be 10 ms. Might affect it, of course.
20220114 - 0074:   This is at 5 ms sweep.
20220114 - 0075:   Yea? Shifted? I think so. Let's take a couple more at same settings while I get coffee.
20220114 - 0076:   these do seem kind of different than no spinflipping.
20220114 - 0082:   For sure shifted, right?
20220114 - 0083:   Let's try to increase the mot coil, to shift other spin clouds further.
20220114 - 0084:   Let's raise the MOT coil voltage to 1.9 V (from 1.5)
20220114 - 0085:   MOT at 1.9. Let's raise PB as well.
20220114 - 0086:   PB at 2 (from 1.8)
20220114 - 0087:   let's go through different times of spinflipping.
20220114 - 0088:   Spinflip - 1 ms - 800mV
20220114 - 0089:   Spinflip - 1 ms - 400mV

(gotta be shifted?)
20220114 - 0090:   Spinflip - 1 ms - 400mV
20220114 - 0091:   Spinflip - 2 ms - 400mV
20220114 - 0092:   Spinflip - 2 ms - 400mV - Interesting. Different than before, more dispersed.
20220114 - 0093:   Spinflip - 3 ms - 400m - thin but a single one.
20220114 - 0094:   Spinflip - 4 ms - 400mV
20220114 - 0095:   Spinflip - 5 ms - 400mV
20220114 - 0096:   Spinflip - 6 ms - 100mV
20220114 - 0098:   Spinflip - 10 ms -100mV - Keep in mind, no rf3 in either of those.
20220114 - 0099:   Spinflip - 10 ms -100mV
20220114 - 0100:   Spinflip - 20 ms -100mV Nothing, makes no sense
20220114 - 0101:   Spinflip - 30 ms -100mV
20220114 - 0102:   Spinflip - 40 ms -100mV - let's try more power. Comeonnnn, why doesn't it work
20220114 - 0104:   Spinflip - 50 ms -500mV I mean it seems shifted
20220114 - 0105:   Fancy? Spinflip - 60 ms -500mV
20220114 - 0106:   Something reminding of a cloud there, but almost nothing. - Spinflip - 60 ms -500mV
20220114 - 0108:   Spinflip - 60 ms -500mV
20220114 - 0110:   Hm, seems a bit wide - Spinflip - 55 ms -350mV
20220114 - 0111:   Spinflip - 55 ms -250mV (there might be a sweet spot between these values)
20220114 - 0112:   !!!! Heyy brotherrrrrrr you are split - alright, at least something. Let's try to play with this.
20220114 - 0113:   Spinflip - 55 ms -290 mV - nothing here. Sad.
20220114 - 0114:   Yep yep. Let's go to 300 mV and check what times work best.
20220114 - 0115:   two parter, but flaky still. Neatly at 300 mV. Let's check at 50 ms of RF.
20220114 - 0116:   Spinflip - 50 ms -350 mV
20220114 - 0117:   50 ms at 350 mV
20220114 - 0118:   Let's try with more cooling - so enable RF3
20220114 - 0119:   Eh. Somewhat, but eeh
20220114 - 0120:   Two parter, surely. At 60 ms + 300 mV
20220114 - 0121:   Yeah, again this is split, for sure, right? Let's optimize it now. Well, not today. But good stuff I think. Let's just try one last thing with quicker IR ramp. 55ms  + 300 mV
20220114 - 0122:   Nice. 55 ms 300 mV RF. Let's try with less tof.
20220114 - 0124:   With 34 tof, same RF params as before.
20220117 - 0002:   Good particle numbers, let's go check the IR
20220117 - 0007:   Change LN2
20220117 - 0010:   particle number seems good, let's go IR
20220117 - 0011:   Try to pick up where we left of.
20220117 - 0012:   Seems roughly where we left off. Need to try a higher tof.
20220117 - 0013:   Hmm, quite dispersed.
20220117 - 0014:   I might have just shone my light when taking the image. Sorry.
20220117 - 0015:   Nothing here. Argh. What's going on. Not where we left off.
20220117 - 0017:   Hm, let's try more RF3 cooling.
20220117 - 0018:   Does not help.
20220117 - 0019:   Try without spinfliping
20220117 - 0020:   Ohhh, RF2 was 0 this entire time. Alright, let's give it another shot.
20220117 - 0025:   Too little tof it seems.
20220117 - 0034:   wonderful
20220117 - 0035:   All of them, real nice.
20220117 - 0040:   All of them, real nice. What do we want to check next
20220117 - 0046:   Higher TOF - further apart - very nice! Looks very promising.
20220117 - 0047:   Try to see how RF3 affects it. But this looks very nice already, let's try to go even lower actually, RF3 from 0 to 20 maybe.
20220117 - 0062:   Seems best. - 78 + 13 + 55ms Spinflip @ 300 mV scan high to low
20220117 - 0064:   Almost dissapears here
20220117 - 0065:   Dissapears here.
20220117 - 0068:   Worth checking how much role the RF power plays, currently at 300 mV
20220117 - 0070:   Lasers messing up.
20220117 - 0071:   Lasers messing up.
20220117 - 0072:   Lasers messing up.
20220117 - 0073:   Lasers messing up.
20220117 - 0074:   Lasers messing up.
20220117 - 0075:   Lasers messing up.
20220117 - 0076:   This is at 0.6 V trap depth. Let's check what happens at lower values.
20220117 - 0079:   At 300 mV spinflip
20220117 - 0080:   At 320 mV spinflip
20220117 - 0081:   At 340 mV spinflip  - Less particles in general, is there something on both sides?
20220117 - 0082:   At 340 mV spinflip - same as before
20220117 - 0083:   At 320 mV spinflip
20220117 - 0084:   At 320 mV spinflip
20220117 - 0085:   At 300 mV spinflip
20220117 - 0086:   290 mV
20220117 - 0087:   290 mV
20220117 - 0088:   280 mV
20220117 - 0091:   agilent at sweep list, set three freqs, 3.5 - A bit narrower, but more or less the same.
20220117 - 0092:   300mV
20220117 - 0093:   seems all in -1 (with the sweep in the opposite way)
20220117 - 0094:   Same. sweep opposite direction, amplitude at 320 mV. Let's try more.
20220117 - 0095:   Same. sweep opposite direction, amplitude at 400 mV.More or less narrower, but still all in -1.
20220117 - 0096:   Swep down and up - 55 ms each, at 300 mV. Seems similar to just sweeping down. Let's try faster upward sweep.
20220117 - 0097:   same params as before. Looks similar.
20220117 - 0098:   Sweep now shorter, but the same slope, we are just cutting the back-up sweep short for 15 ms. So 55 ms of sweep down from 3.5 to 2 ,and then 40 ms sweep from 2 to whatever
20220117 - 0099:   Now faster sweep backwards, only 45 ms. Doesn't seem to affect it much.
20220117 - 0100:   Making the back sweep faster, nothing much. Maybe overall a bit fainter.
20220117 - 0101:   Trying sweep both ways.
20220117 - 0102:   Not much difference. Let's perhaps have a look at reversing the sweep direction, which should bring us to the other state.
20220117 - 0103:   at 25 ms of TOF. let's check what happens when we increase the tof, if they fly apart, then we are dealing with (+ 1 and -1), and if only one moves, then -1 and 0 (right?)
20220117 - 0115:   I think this is pretty conclusive. One of the domains is more or less still (0) and the other one moves.
20220117 - 0116:   Inverted freqs range - over 55 ms and with only 10 ms tof
20220117 - 0117:   300 mV - Let's figure out how to make a proper transition to +1 state. We know we should sweep the frequency in the opposite way, see figure in Bons' thesis. But just inverting what we did for the case of the flip in the other way doesn't work.
20220117 - 0118:   100 mV - nothing. Keeping it at 55 ms for now.
20220117 - 0119:   200 mV - 55 ms
20220117 - 0120:   400 mV - 55 ms
20220117 - 0121:   500 mV - 55 ms
20220117 - 0122:   600 mV - 55 ms

20220117 - 0124:   300 mV - 45 ms
20220117 - 0125:   300 mV - 60 ms
20220117 - 0126:   300 mV - 65 ms
20220117 - 0127:   300 mV - 30 ms
20220117 - 0128:   300 mV - 45 ms
20220117 - 0129:   300 mV - 45 ms
20220117 - 0130:   300 mV - 45 ms     - different tofs
20220117 - 0131:   300 mV - 45 ms     - different tofs
20220117 - 0132:   300 mV - 45 ms     - different tofs (thus, different times of SG splitting)
20220117 - 0133:   300 mV - 50 ms
20220117 - 0134:   300 mv - 50 ms
20220117 - 0135:   300 mV - 50 ms
20220117 - 0136:   300 mV - 40 ms

20220119 - 0035:   Still empty! :o
20220119 - 0056:   Different direction sweep  2 - 4 MHz, same time
20220119 - 0060:   Back to usual.
20220119 - 0071:   With sweep front and back. I believe. (55 + 25)

20220124 - 0016:   Alright, let's try now with the IR
20220124 - 0086:   No BEC, but a very clear image. Let's make sure with TI we have a condensate. Prevous looks quite good though.
20220124 - 0092:   Empty. Let's go to the tested script.
20220127 - 0000:   Particle number on the low side, perhaps the lasers drifted a bit, and we should optimize the powers. Haven't done it in a while.
20220127 - 0010:   Can't get Zeeman above 160 mW :/ Back to the problematic laser :/
20220127 - 0033:   Using an old, shorter script, modified for making BEC's, no decompressions.
20220127 - 0037:   Looks better, higher cond fraction.
20220127 - 0043:   getting better
20220127 - 0044:   Looks pretty well condensed actually. Still some thermal cloud through.
20220127 - 0045:   All gone :/
20220127 - 0046:   Here, but smaller.
20220127 - 0047:   Curves seem to work neatly.
20220127 - 0050:   Running while lnuching
20220127 - 0060:   Lost it here
20220127 - 0067:   Seems to have exploaded a bit, blah
20220127 - 0068:   All empty ^
20220127 - 0079:   Ah bro, lasers got unlocked
20220128 - 0007:   Bljah, huge problems with F=1 laser :/
20220128 - 0009:   Nice, but god damn, such a low particle number. We might need to optimize the Zeeman laser again.
20220128 - 0010:   Still, more or less comparible to yesterday?
20220128 - 0011:   So little atoms :/
20220128 - 0013:   More tof gives a higher particle number, but that should not :o
20220128 - 0015:   blah, small small
20220128 - 0016:   And empty. Cooling too much I guess, for too little atoms
20220128 - 0024:   Looks a bit better. Let's try higher RF times
20220128 - 0026:   better
20220128 - 0029:   B E A U T Y
20220128 - 0030:   gone :/
20220128 - 0033:   Loosing it a bit here
20220128 - 0035:   smoll smoll
20220128 - 0038:   Where are the condensates going?
20220128 - 0069:   Seems a bit unrealible whether we observe the condensate or not. Hmm.
20220128 - 0077:   lasers unlocked.
20220128 - 0078:   Cool cool, let's go OAH after the enxt one.
20220128 - 0079:   Okay, now let's try OAH
20220128 - 0080:   Forgot to open the reference beam channel - but it looks promising
20220128 - 0081:   Nicee!! But the optical density is almost too much at the center, might need to adjust the colorbar
20220128 - 0083:   also empty. hmm
20220128 - 0084:   Also empty. Odd odd
20220128 - 0087:   Again nothing, but MOT is there. Let's try a bit less of the cooling.
20220128 - 0088:   Still empty.
20220128 - 0089:   Still. Let's go to 79 cooling time
20220128 - 0092:   Looks like something there.
20220128 - 0093:   Also little something, might be worth checking this for the optimal focus factor
20220128 - 0097:   Back having it!
20220128 - 0098:   Looks like some problems with unwrapping? But nice though- at 78 seconds though.
20220128 - 0099:   Interesting, let's try a few ms of tof
20220128 - 0101:   Little bit of a tof. Try more?
20220128 - 0102:   Pretty!
20220128 - 0103:   Beautiful, even with a higher tof
20220128 - 0110:   These last few look nice. vlims = 6, 0
20220128 - 0114:   More tof?

20220128 - 0172:   PROBE + BEAM 1 + BEAM 2  Let's optimize the reference beams powers.
20220128 - 0173:   Both beams after optimization - it seems like a nice interference, to be honest. However, we lost LN2 so, no condensates from here on out
20220128 - 0175:   Not as nice.
20220201 - 0001:   Have it, but a low paricle number. The problem is that the laser power is way too low, we're at 130 mW power for Zeeman, which is shit.
20220201 - 0103:   It's gone to shit
20220201 - 0115:   At 60 seconds the particle number is shit. Gotta be the laser powers issue, let's retune them.
20220324 - 0017:   With extremely low RF time
20220324 - 0018:   Subtract 18 seconds RF
20220324 - 0026:   --- start optimizing ----
20220324 - 0027:   H 1aC (horizontal 1 anti-clockwise)
20220324 - 0034:   H 2aC
20220328 - 0003:   Same as before, we have something gaussian, but not reliable enough really. Will probably have to realign the laser beam. But then again, might make more sense to first replace the mirrors, now that we are so confident with moving them.
20220328 - 0010:   More gaussian at lower RF times of course.
20220331 - 0066:   CC
20220331 - 0070:   well this is shit, this is with way reduced rf time
20220331 - 0077:   CC
20220331 - 0091:   2 x CW
20220331 - 0104:   CW
20220331 - 0126:   2 x CW
20220331 - 0135:   Too much RF to see anything :/
20220401 - 0010:   Looks like something there
20220401 - 0236:   This is so weird, there is this line, but not atoms I think. Next one is with the MOT valve closed.
20220401 - 0237:   maybe shutter pulse?
20220401 - 0238:   It is bigger - so perhaps indeed the pulse. We need a longer pulse because light needs longerr
20220401 - 0241:   better
20220401 - 0420:   Looks goodish, so this is with the sync MT off - the moment I turn it on I lose this apparently. The step lasts 3ms, in which the magnetic trap is turned on.
20220404 - 0011:   re-align all MOT beams to match their back reflections
20220404 - 0014:   Probe power too low - up it here
20220404 - 0015:   Notice that the MOT repump was too low - uped it here
20220404 - 0016:   Wait up, perhaps also spinpol is too low. If the laser shited a bit. Let's fix that.
20220404 - 0017:   Sssttill nothing here COME ON
20220405 - 0024:   Looks gaussian
20220405 - 0027:   Still gaussian, try to increase the pulse
20220405 - 0030:   I guess still gaussian, is it tough
20220405 - 0032:   Tricky to tell
20220405 - 0033:   Wouldn't say this is gaussian, but it does seem to have a high absorption. So it disperses very quickly, is that fair to assume?
20220405 - 0034:   those were with a high TOF really
20220405 - 0035:   Looks a bit better peraps
20220405 - 0036:   Okay, gaussian
20220405 - 0037:   Def Gaussian
20220405 - 0038:   With more decomp
20220405 - 0039:   Yeah, starts to lose its gaussianity
20220405 - 0041:   2 s of compress of MT seems too much
20220405 - 0042:   This still seems fine -  1s
20220405 - 0043:   
20220405 - 0044:   1s decom + 1s RF similar
20220405 - 0045:   Seems like decompressing messes it up, let's try to skip that step
20220405 - 0046:   Full on empty
20220405 - 0051:   Scary good
20220405 - 0056:   after 10 s of decomp. What. Let's try this again.
20220405 - 0057:   Looks sameee. wait is this one of those pulses shits?
20220405 - 0058:   let's try to up the pulse time
20220405 - 0060:   Same with the higher pulse.
20220405 - 0061:   Same with higher pulse, seems reliable okay. Perhaps the problem is that with the particle number that we have atm, the RF pulse just fucks everything up. Or indeed, the MOT is too hot and we get rid of most of the particles quickly by spin flipping them. What is the remedy for that though?
20220405 - 0062:   Okay, so here's what it could be the reason - we have something just until we turn on the RF, which could cause all the atoms to flip and escape. So it seems like we have a hot MOT, and no matter how good that sounds, that's no good :/. But what is the remedy?
20220405 - 0063:   This is after 0.9 seconds after holding the particles in the trap.
20220405 - 0064:   After 3 seconds holding it in the trap. Let's just schedule a few runs like these to investigate how nicely we are keeping the atoms.
20220405 - 0070:   Let's do a list ^^^
20220405 - 0101:   List end
20220405 - 0153:   RF Enabled ^^^^
20220405 - 0202:   Cool cool, let's try to raise the RF curves, to see if that helps with the hot atoms.
20220405 - 0203:   Seems higher at first glance 56 -> 80
20220405 - 0204:   Could be too high - then its just thold
20220407 - 0036:   Here we go! It was the atom shutter.
20220407 - 0103:   Going the right way seems

20220411 - 0293:   CCW
20220412 - 0068:   Lekker. At this point, I hooked up the LN
20220412 - 0072:   Sheesh bro
20220412 - 0073:   We're talkingggggg
20220412 - 0147:   Jeezzz
20220413 - 0029:   About 250M - nicey
20220413 - 0040:   Decompressed - No BEC though
20220413 - 0071:   Emptier, ran out of LN
20220413 - 0073:   No LN
20220421 - 0169:   Nice TF profile.
20220421 - 0170:   Lekker, looks condensed. Maybe check for TC? Or try holography? Looks like a condensate.
20220421 - 0173:   Empty - seems like the curves messed it up :S didn't write it down though
20220421 - 0199:   Heyyy time crystal buddy. Wonderful
20220421 - 0200:   Very skewed, seems like a big mode. Let's try stronger kick.
20220421 - 0201:   yep, mode still there, but seems different.
20220421 - 0202:   sexy bexy beaut - kick at 3.81
20220421 - 0203:   Still TC
20220421 - 0204:   Still TC
20220421 - 0208:   TC BOI
20220422 - 0001:   emptyish, but no LN also
20220422 - 0003:   Less tof - more pronounced. let's get LN
20220422 - 0016:   Hooked up LN here, should see a steady rise in particle number now. Please.
20220422 - 0039:   Start optimizing the Zeeman beam here.
20220422 - 0057:   seems like a rise to me. This is H clockwise.
20220422 - 0246:   going to more cooling. This should be just before condensation.
20220422 - 0249:   seems just after the condensation at 18s RF2
20220422 - 0252:   Seems just before the condensation at 17s RF2
20220422 - 0254:   Already too condensed to be stretched. Let's say 16 seconds and then stretch. Or raise the curves at keep it at 18?
20220422 - 0257:   Just before.
20220422 - 0258:   Let's try to decompress this now.
20220422 - 0259:   Empty.
20220422 - 0260:   Still empty.
20220422 - 0263:   no tof - cloud there.
20220422 - 0265:   Losing it with the decompression :o Might be because the duration of the decomp RF2 channel is set too long - let's lower it to just the 16 seconds. Fingers crossed. It's gotta be it.
20220422 - 0266:   Ya BOI - possibly the issue I suspected, the RF time thing. Let's increase the tof
20220422 - 0268:   Pretty okay cool cool. At 20M particles in total :/ Let's go with some RF3 as well.
20220422 - 0272:   Getting there
20220422 - 0273:   Nice! But not even a million particles.
20220422 - 0274:   Smaller.
20220422 - 0280:   Not enough cooling.
20220422 - 0282:   out of LN again :o
20220426 - 0029:   Empty
20220426 - 0030:   Empty
20220426 - 0050:   And you can put your comments here. AND THEN save
20220428 - 0001:   Probe + REF 1.   Full frame, single image. Empty
20220428 - 0002:   Probe + REF 1.   Full frame, 15 imgs, 50ms inbetween. Empty.
20220428 - 0005:   Looks like double interference. Should be just the second beam.
20220428 - 0007:   Lemme try to close the other beam fully.
20220428 - 0008:   Probe + REF 2
20220428 - 0009:   Better, but seems like a worse contrast than with the first beam.
20220428 - 0012:   None of the OAH's work for this one, hell?
20220428 - 0016:   Let's try to fix the interference of the second beam. How? Maybe monitoring the fourier transform?
20220428 - 0019:   The two beam somehow seem to shift on to another, always get a different place of the maximum interferance
20220428 - 0021:   Again, completley different, why is that?
20220428 - 0023:   100 images of the same interference pattern, separated by 50ms ish.
20220428 - 0033:   Looks good but in the Fourier plane there is a weird artefact, and that's a fact. What is it? Some additional frequency component I guess? I wonder if I can just fix the fourier plane, and then get it nicely out? Or I mean that is kindof the same as better choosing the cutout. Maybe I could expand the method for analysis for OAH better. Good idea. While Jillis works on the condensates.
20220428 - 0034:   Good on the right side only.
20220428 - 0042:   This looks 3D, pretty cool actually haha.
20220428 - 0044:   Let's go to top imaging normal absorption -> let's check 60 secs and then condense
20220428 - 0048:   
20220428 - 0053:   iterating though rftime2 values, 16-20
20220428 - 0055:   cloud foms, low count
20220428 - 0056:   rft2=19, decent N particles
20220428 - 0057:   rf curve didnt extend to 20s, redo!
20220428 - 0058:   rft2=20, better!
20220428 - 0059:   rft2=20 works well enough
20220428 - 0061:   rft2=20 seems to work well enough
20220428 - 0062:   Lost cloud, varying rft3 17-20
20220428 - 0063:   rft3=17, very minimal cloud.
20220428 - 0066:   lost it  at rft3=20, 18 seems optimal
20220428 - 0069:   cloud using rf3 curve ref1 (last 2 pics)
20220428 - 0072:   much higher rf curve, i am losing particles in the rf3 stage
20220428 - 0074:   lowering curve
20220428 - 0079:   changing 5s mark on rf3
20220428 - 0082:   10s mark
20220428 - 0086:   BEC!!!!
20220428 - 0089:   Bec with ref curve 2

20220429 - 0069:   20s
20220429 - 0071:   seems steady enough at 17s
20220429 - 0072:   rf3 curve is way off :(
20220429 - 0079:   good counts!
20220429 - 0083:   rf2 curve is of whack..
20220429 - 0084:   
20220429 - 0085:

20220429 - 0103:   Nice
20220429 - 0104:   NICE!
20220429 - 0111:   after decomp, losing to many particles ->reoptimizing rf2
how much do i have in the mot?
20220429 - 0112:   raised rf2 slightly, looks ok
20220429 - 0113:   MOT 223M particles <-- Not MOT. This is 60 seconds after the transfer
20220429 - 0115:   rf2 acceptable, loss after decomp?
20220429 - 0116:   15-20% ish loss after decomp
20220429 - 0118:   rf3 3s mark, 3s mark 3-3.4Hz
20220429 - 0119:   3.15

20220429 - 0131:   Pulse messed up
20220429 - 0137:   Empty
20220502 - 0024:   Ran out of LN2, so let's repeate the last few runs. But tbh it doesn't seem like the loading time affects it too much.
20220502 - 0101:   Finished the day with plethora of OAH runs - just the light interference
20220503 - 0000:   Starting without LN2. Started it now here.
20220503 - 0033:   Lost the MOT, the batteries of the flipping mirror ran out
20220503 - 0071:   Looks good more or less. 7 seconds decomp time seems to work just fine
20220503 - 0075:   Or 10 is also good. Let's keep it here.
20220503 - 0091:   Looks good tbh, but not very dense it seems. Not really saturated at the peak.
20220503 - 0118:   that looks better, 2M condensate. Would love to have a bigger one though
20220503 - 0122:   looks good good, almost 3M particles
20220503 - 0123:   Nice, looks better a bit than before, looking like 2Ms
20220503 - 0125:   Looks good-y, let's try some stuff, let's do the same but speed up the curves.
20220503 - 0171:   Pretty, without decompression --> should a higher particle number at 60 mean a more rapid cooling because faster rethermalisation
20220504 - 0009:   Optimized the laser beam
20220504 - 0012:   Lower tof seems to give me lower particle numers, althought it should be accounted for in the calculation
20220504 - 0018:   Hm, checking the code, it does not take into account the time of flight :o I need to recheck the code then
20220504 - 0025:   Wait a sec, actually you do not need tof to calculate the particle number from a gaussian distribution - you simply integrate it
20220504 - 0042:   Just before the condensation, just below 20M particles here.
20220504 - 0045:   Speeded up the curves, quicker
20220504 - 0050:   Faster cooling, but it seems like the particle number is lower just before condensation
20220504 - 0051:   Possibly not worse? Let's try even faster maybe?
20220504 - 0055:   Seems too fast now, not even at condensation
20220504 - 0059:   Looking pretty condensed
20220504 - 0063:   2.5M particles in the condensate
20220504 - 0069:   So all of those runs on the same set of curves ->
20220504 - 0070:   What a stupid boy I am, I changed and modified the curves, but I was using a different set of curves in my generator. FML
20220504 - 0090:   Let's try to speed it up, for real this time. This looks good, but still a bit before the condensation. I also want to try to see if a kick does it any good.
20220504 - 0108:   Not bad, but not many particles in the condensate. Seems like RF3 curve is off.
20220504 - 0121:   Nope, too little particles
20220504 - 0149:   those are pretty decent
20220504 - 0151:   Pretty well condensed, I'd say even more than 85%
20220504 - 0154:   try with the kick, no effect
20220506 - 0018:   Seems pretty low already, no? Let's do the entire curve.
20220506 - 0045:   this looks pretty big, also maybe the fitting is not working perfectly? It doesn't seem to match it too briliantly :/ Might be more particles
20220506 - 0046:   Nice condensate, about 5M particles! But the TF fit and Bimodal fit give me different values :/
20220506 - 0047:   yeah boy, I trust this 100% here even. Def nicely condensed.
20220506 - 0048:   Very nice and efficient condensates. This script here seems to produce nice condensates for about 200M particles at 60 seconds (at tof 15).
20220506 - 0049:   Yeah, nice
20220506 - 0050:   Higher tof seems to give me higher particle numbers in the condensate, although the cloud seems to be fitted nicely. Hm, is my fitting routine wrong?
20220506 - 0051:   Hm, this  is with comp coils off in the tof, and it seems to have much more thermal gas
20220506 - 0052:   yep, confirms the theory
20220506 - 0053:   This is back to pure condensate.
20220506 - 0054:   Don't know why the fitting is being a mess. But this is a pure condensate imo
20220506 - 0057:   fml, lasers got unlocked and after I got them back everything went to shit
20220506 - 0058:   Maybe not all went to shit, okay okay. This is with a more rapid cooling at the begining, let's run it there for a while, to see if we make any progress. Not enxt one though
20220506 - 0084:   Works again
20220510 - 0004:   Fair number, small laser power still though.
20220510 - 0068:   Out of LN2
20220510 - 0074:   LN ran out and this is the end for today, if I'm being honest
20220511 - 0025:   Coolio. Let's try with the IR laser on, but with no decompression. Honestly doubt that the laser is still aligned with the trap, so probably wont see anything? Or maybe?
20220511 - 0026:   Yep, empty
20220511 - 0028:   with tof, no laser can be seen
20220511 - 0030:   Doesn't seem aligned :/ I think we need to go to fluorescent imaging, and then realign the IR.
20220511 - 0033:   Fluorescent imaging
20220511 - 0102:   i have no idea whats going on.. Could also be a shutter problem, sometimes they get stuck a bit
20220511 - 0103:   Yeah, back to normal, low particle numbers though. IO think the lasers might drop in power again,. Are you changing the curve up to the 60 seconds point? ->no
nitrogen was at0.07ish, i upped it a bit, alright, don't imagine it would affec it that much
20220511 - 0105:   still low :(

--let's wrap up, there's a borrel !! 
oki
20220512 - 0037:   Slowly rising numbers
20220512 - 0042:   Alright this looks quite nice, well saturated at the bottom
20220512 - 0043:   Quite a good batch, let's be honest
20220512 - 0045:   Lekekr.
20220512 - 0050:   Still condensed a bit
20220512 - 0078:   Fluorescence
20220512 - 0084:   no tof, but the cloud is there. I'll try to keep the laser on during the tof. Surely that's gonna show something?
20220512 - 0085:   tof, but no laser effect
20220512 - 0088:   Condensate ish but no laser stuff :/
20220512 - 0094:   Ran out of LN2
20220513 - 0031:   60s MT
20220513 - 0036:   end 60sMT
20220513 - 0052:   something is wrong..
20220513 - 0054:   Looks fine to me here
20220513 - 0064:   rf scan start
20220513 - 0071:   wut?
20220517 - 0024:   Seems like the time before the imaging affects the darkness? weird, not sure really why, gotta be something with the camera.
20220518 - 0009:   Nice condensate
20220518 - 0011:   Gone empty
20220518 - 0013:   Nice Condensate
20220518 - 0014:   Actually very nice thermal cloud
20220518 - 0015:   Actually very nice thermal cloud
20220518 - 0016:   Take 25 images, with about 130 ms inbetween
20220518 - 0017:   Take 25 images with about a second inbetween
20220518 - 0018:   Same as below
20220518 - 0019:   Same as below
20220518 - 0020:   Same as below
20220518 - 0021:   Now, we image through cooling. Here's the deal - we use 5 seconds cooling with RF2 curve, then ideally (if I set it up correctly) we take one image once every 1080 ms (+0.05ms for imaging) and while we do so, we also cool. Let's hope this whill show in the particle number, although I am still struggling a lot with a relaible fitting.
20220518 - 0022:   Same as below
20220518 - 0023:   Sasme as below
20220518 - 0024:   Seems like we are not cooling this way. This is at much higher RF time to begin with, and then image there. Condensate, real nice one.
20220518 - 0025:   Actually, maybe the problem was elsewhere, I might have forgot to enable one of the channels to include RF cooling as well. Let's try again, starting at 5  s cooling, and then take 10 images through the transition, hopefully.
20220518 - 0026:   Yessss, it works!!!!
20220518 - 0027:   Great, we can image through cooling. This is 25 images, with 100 ms between, so this is across 2.5 seconds.
20220518 - 0028:   Empty.
20220518 - 0029:   Nice, transition
20220518 - 0030:   Faint, whatever it is
20220518 - 0033:   LN flow was pretty low here, so I think that could be the reason
20220518 - 0034:   I think as before - blaming it on LN2
20220523 - 0023:   Condensate
20220523 - 0032:   LN still settling in
20220523 - 0084:   15 images
20220523 - 0085:   15 images - Nice cooling sequence here.
20220523 - 0086:   Likewise. Let's get a sequence and then average
20220524 - 0002:   Says 15 ms tof, but it's 0
20220524 - 0029:   
20220524 - 0030:   
20220524 - 0031:   
20220524 - 0032:   
20220524 - 0033:   
20220524 - 0061:   Definetely moved - maybe just because tof?
20220524 - 0066:   I think you can for sure tell something is affecting it. Perhaps not perfectly hitting it?
20220524 - 0067:   I think left-right adjustment might help? Let's go slightly clockwise with the IR. Seems kinda it was dragged left to right (or other way)
20220524 - 0068:   Hm, let's try to turn off the MT when turning on the IR, so getting rid of atoms trapped magnetically.
20220524 - 0082:   
20220524 - 0102:   Nothing
20220524 - 0110:   No significant difference with the laser off.
20220524 - 0118:   am I out of Ln
20220601 - 0009:   Both ref beams
20220601 - 0010:   First ref beam
20220601 - 0011:   Second ref beam (all no probe)
20220601 - 0012:   Both
20220601 - 0013:   First
20220601 - 0014:   Second
20220601 - 0027:   1st beam
20220601 - 0030:   2nd beam, decent
20220601 - 0031:   2nd beam good!
20220601 - 0032:   1st beam
20220601 - 0033:   wierd artefact
20220601 - 0038:   1st beam good
20220601 - 0039:   both ref beams on
20220602 - 0193:   Call it for today
20220603 - 0040:   Something is off.
20220603 - 0041:   Don't like this. It seems like the particle number is very low, too low.
20220603 - 0079:   Hooked LN  but doesn't seem to help much
20220603 - 0085:   No, particle number still shit at 60 secs. let's check the laser powers and beam alignement
20220603 - 0089:   Re-centered the beams, no improvement.
20220603 - 0090:   Maybe try realign again the main Zeeman beam? Don't have many other ideas :/
20220603 - 0118:   The MOT repump was a bit low (~7mw). Upped it to about 10mW, no significant difference :/
20220608 - 0004:   Even after the recirculation, still low particle number. lemme check the LN again
20220608 - 0005:   LN normally flowing.. What the hell?
20220608 - 0006:   The spot looks alright on the monitor
20220608 - 0007:   Maybe something in the code?
20220608 - 0021:   I mean a tiny bit higher, but not really
20220608 - 0096:   As a function of thold
20220608 - 0136:   thold in ms
20220608 - 0152:   With smaller illumination strength - seems to give us more particles ? Hm.
20220608 - 0153:   But still, abysmally small.
20220608 - 0170:   Try OAH, with thermal cloud
20220609 - 0001:   
20220609 - 0002:

20220609 - 0007:   
20220609 - 0008:   Carefully I could say this seems better

20220609 - 0024:   
20220609 - 0025:   
20220609 - 0026:   Still, the particle numbers are higher than yesterday, but smaller than a week ago.
20220609 - 0027:   It seems to decrease with time. I wonder if that is perhaps some overheating effect or something. Let's give it a rest for half an hour or so, and then try again, the same thing.
20220609 - 0028:   Break
20220609 - 0029:   Not much change

20220610 - 0031:   Increased the nitrogen flow, seems to yield much higher particle numbers?
20220614 - 0001:   All empty
20220614 - 0003:   Coils failed for some reason, safety, I think. Odd, it's been a while since that happened.
20220614 - 0005:   
20220614 - 0007:   Already wit the LN. At 200M, not ideal, not too bad :/
20220614 - 0009:   let's maybe play with the MOT repump knob a bit
20220614 - 0010:   Bottom Clockwise Mot Repump (next one)
20220614 - 0014:   B +CW
20220614 - 0018:   B +CW
20220614 - 0022:   B +CW
20220614 - 0024:   Looks like a slight improvement
20220614 - 0025:   Pressure just a bit above 0.1
20220614 - 0030:   B +CW
20220614 - 0039:   T +CW
20220614 - 0041:   perhaps wrong way
20220614 - 0042:   T +CCW
20220614 - 0044:   T +CCW
20220614 - 0049:   T +CCW - seems to help it here. In some runs, Jillis will take over and optimize the Zeeman slower beam.
20220614 - 0052:   Perhaps too far. Should probably turn it back a tiny bit before proceeding
20220614 - 0053:   Yeah, seems to decrease a bit. Might have hit the optimum just before.
20220614 - 0082:   Run 50-80 N2 was too low, no changes to were made
20220614 - 0084:   1st measurement above .1 n2
20220614 - 0087:   n2 line leaking, stopping runs
20220614 - 0092:   lost the mot
20220614 - 0098:   up and running again
20220614 - 0102:   baseline, seems stable
20220614 - 0103:   T CCW
20220614 - 0106:   slighty worse
20220614 - 0107:   T CW
20220614 - 0111:   lots worse, must have overshot sweet spot
20220614 - 0112:   T CCW
20220614 - 0117:   T CCW
20220614 - 0119:   okay, i overshot by quite a bit. slowly walking back ccw...
20220614 - 0122:   T CCW
20220614 - 0127:   going the wrong way i guess
20220614 - 0128:   T CW
20220615 - 0009:   Optimize MOT repump beam T +CCW
20220615 - 0013:   Upped the LN just a touch. Now we are just abouve 0.1 line
20220615 - 0015:   T +CCW
20220615 - 0020:   T +CW
20220615 - 0024:   T + CW

20220615 - 0036:   T +CW
20220615 - 0045:   let's go to bottom, horizontal alignment, B +CW
20220615 - 0046:   
20220615 - 0049:   B +CCW

20220615 - 0069:   B +CW
20220615 - 0077:   B+CCW
20220615 - 0085:   Particl number droping a bit. Perhaps it has to do with the vacuum?
20220615 - 0087:   What the hell is going on?  The pnum is dropping
20220615 - 0088:   Empty, for no reason
20220615 - 0091:   Coils failed
20220615 - 0095:   B +CCW

20220615 - 0150:   Stop the measurement to see if anything is overheating ->> STOP: 13:48
20220615 - 0151:   Jump in particle number. Interesting.
20220615 - 0160:   T CW
20220615 - 0164:   T CCW
20220615 - 0167:   The hell? Did the laser power drop again, so quickly?
20220615 - 0169:   T CW
20220615 - 0175:   T 2xCCW
20220615 - 0193:   Longer loading times seems to give more time for AOM's to recool.
20220615 - 0194:   20 s loading time
20220615 - 0236:   B +CW
20220615 - 0240:   B + CW
20220615 - 0244:   B + CW
20220615 - 0246:   B + 3x CCW
20220615 - 0256:   T CW
20220617 - 0065:   I just want to get some condensates today and take OAH images we can analyse later.
20220617 - 0072:   MM okay, about a million particles in the condensate. Let's do a couple more and then OAH.
20220617 - 0073:   I mean cool cool. Let's do OAH
20220617 - 0075:   Looks quite sad :/
20220617 - 0076:   go to OAH
20220617 - 0082:   A bit  weak. let's try to dump all of the laser light into one ref beam, and check if that improves the resolution. The condensates are tiny tiny though.
20220617 - 0083:   Second peak looks much much better. (quad 2 I mean)
20220617 - 0085:   But also just ran out of LN2 so this I thin kreduced the condensate sizes massively..
20220617 - 0086:   Let' shut it
20220617 - 0087:   Lost condensates here
20220627 - 0000:   Empty - at no tof. Magnetic coils failed.
20220627 - 0004:   Turned on LN here.
20220627 - 0005:   Need some time I guess. But the particle number seems no better at all.
20220627 - 0008:   Shit, this is not too good.
20220627 - 0025:   Oke oke - Let's optimzie the Zeeman beam (assuming MOT R is fine).
20220627 - 0026:   H CCW
20220627 - 0027:   Uf no no
20220627 - 0029:   H CW
20220627 - 0033:   H CW
20220627 - 0041:   H CW
20220627 - 0044:   H CW
20220627 - 0046:   Heyo
20220627 - 0050:   H CW
20220627 - 0052:   Wohou, where is this coming from? Just the poor alignment? Christ, this looks like plenty good.
20220627 - 0054:   H CW
20220627 - 0056:   New high
20220627 - 0057:   H CW
20220627 - 0059:   Alright, seems like a bit lower. Let's do a few more then go back.
20220627 - 0060:   H CCW
20220627 - 0062:   H CCW
20220627 - 0064:   Maybe too much CCW. let's go one back H CW
20220627 - 0067:   H CCW
20220627 - 0070:   Fine. Let's go to Vertical axis.
20220627 - 0071:   V CW
20220627 - 0074:   V CCW
20220627 - 0078:   V CCW - strange, going the wrong way. Perhaps I had it fine
20220627 - 0080:   Over the limit. V CW
20220627 - 0084:   Let's go in extremely small increments now. V CW
20220627 - 0088:   V CW
20220627 - 0091:   V CW
20220627 - 0095:   Consistent, but not really as high as I had it. Perhaps this is partially explaiend by the lasers drifting.
20220627 - 0096:   V CW
20220627 - 0101:   let's re-optimize the lasers.
20220627 - 0103:   Re-powered the lasers.
20220627 - 0105:   V CW
20220627 - 0107:   V CCW
20220627 - 0112:   V 2xCW
20220627 - 0114:   If anything, worse.
20220627 - 0125:   V CCW
20220627 - 0131:   V CCW
20220627 - 0140:   V CCW
20220627 - 0147:   V CCW
20220627 - 0149:   Too much?
20220627 - 0151:   V CW
20220627 - 0155:   V CW
20220627 - 0163:   That looks better. Small tiny change still?
20220627 - 0165:   If next one is fine we go to BEC, optimize that, and get some nice OAH condensate images.
20220627 - 0167:   Oy mama, looks like a sweet spot. Let's keep it running here for a little bit, just to see how reliable this number is.
20220627 - 0170:   Maybe a slight slight adjustment of the V CW, or am I greedy?
20220627 - 0176:   man, here we go now
20220627 - 0181:   Looks pretty strong, ish.
20220627 - 0190:   Let's try with the decompression. Particle number seems pretty similar to Sam's data, so lets see where we at if we just use that same code.
20220627 - 0191:   yeah okay. let's see just before decompression where we at.
20220627 - 0193:   Okay, so not quite at the BEC level. Let's optimize the curves for this particle number, to get to BEC roughly at 20 seconds cooling.
20220627 - 0195:   Hm, hard to say if this is the begining of condensation, my guess is more like no.
20220627 - 0210:   Still no condensate, am I modding the right curves even?
20220627 - 0217:   Alright, looks better, so we have an idea where the condensation happens.
20220627 - 0219:   Nice, looks like a pure condensate, decent in size
20220627 - 0220:   Might be time to quickly optimize the laser powers, and also, let's just do this ones in OAH, so I have something to analyse. Actually, do I want to decompress it first?
20220627 - 0223:   Go to OAH
20220627 - 0224:   Nice. Let's see it with some OAH. OAH-1 seems to have a much worse resolution :/, perhaps we need to refocus it a bit.
20220627 - 0225:   Let's go to some tof, to see what we are dealing with.
20220627 - 0226:   Not a good contrast. Let's dump all the power in one beam first, then the other.
20220627 - 0227:   It would be worth checkig the difference between the optimal focuse for the two beams.
20220627 - 0228:   Lekker.
20220627 - 0229:   Seems a bit sad.

20220627 - 0242:   OAH 1 ---> 10 TOF
20220627 - 0243:   OAH 1 ---> 10 TOF  - almost nothing can be seen.
20220627 - 0244:   OAH 1 ---> 10 TOF  - let's just crazily go to decompression.
20220627 - 0245:   yeah empty, I figured.
20220627 - 0246:   idk, maybe something vague?
20220627 - 0247:   Let's wrap it up for today. Tomorrow, let's try to optimize the cooling and get some nice decompressed condensates and OAH it
20220628 - 0005:   No LN, looks decent for low vacuum
20220628 - 0008:   Hooked up LN
20220628 - 0017:   Still rising so let it steady
20220628 - 0021:   Kay, looking steady, moving on.
20220628 - 0024:   This looks like lasers unlocking or something?
20220628 - 0038:   Strange, so it seems like this is too deep, to violently.
20220628 - 0039:   Okay so it does actually dissapear here.
20220628 - 0047:   Still. Interesting, going too deep it seems to quickly. Let's aim for this at 20 secs or so
20220628 - 0064:   Nice, cool cool, condensates just as I am leaving I see, typical. Not super big though
20220628 - 0065:   Delish
20220628 - 0066:   Looks good, we'll go to OAH, let's check a bit more
20220628 - 0067:   It has this little shaddow underneath still
20220628 - 0068:   2 mills in the condensate, ehh, could probably be better with the cooling optimization
20220628 - 0069:   Okay okay, not sure what cooling time is best though
20220628 - 0070:   Maybe too much
20220628 - 0071:   U nicey grand
20220628 - 0074:   Maybe a bit too much cooling?
20220628 - 0092:   Hm also not the greatest condensates with top imaging, perhaps explains the poor contrast in the OAH.
20220720 - 0002:   Alright Alright, this is without any laser optimization, but yesterdays power readings showed a nice 140mW, so no complaints there. But it might be quite close to the upper limit.
20220720 - 0003:   Lekker business. Let's try straight up condensates, this might be close to what we had last time.
20220720 - 0038:   This looks a bit more condensaty. Let's play with the curves.
20220720 - 0040:   Starting to look better and better. Might want to go to OAH if it looks this good. Let's also check at 0 tof.
20220720 - 0041:   Still, I also want to play with the curves a little bit.
20220720 - 0043:   WOAH, this looks great. Let's stay here and go to OAH. Played with the curves a little bit, let's see this first.
20220720 - 0045:   Doesn't quite seem super condensed.
20220720 - 0046:   Maybe modify the curves a bit more. Let's focus on that for now.
20220720 - 0047:   Modified the curves ^
20220720 - 0048:   Let's decrease the time a bit as well.
20220720 - 0050:   Less RF3 but shows more thermal cloud
20220720 - 0053:   Seems worse than before.
20220720 - 0056:   Perhaps we went the wrong way, let's try slightly longer cooling, with a bit less powerful cooling, if that makes sense.
20220722 - 0005:   Even better than yesterday
20220722 - 0007:   Tried straight up to full cooling, almost there.
20220722 - 0018:   Let's try a non-compressed condensates.
20220722 - 0023:   mm nice condensate. About 6 million Let's add a kick to it
20220722 - 0024:   Try with a kick
20220722 - 0026:   Uf some funcky shit going on here This is with a kick, but it seems like the condensate split in two. Kick at 3.81
20220722 - 0027:   But no axial mode. Try a stronger kick? 3.80 (no. 29)
20220722 - 0029:   Whattttttt is this? Maybe I need to wait longer for the mode to stabilize?
20220722 - 0030:   Almost a perfect condensate. Thold to 300 ms.
20220722 - 0031:   Great condensates though. Not super big, but pretty consistent and pure.
20220722 - 0032:   More thold, but this looks messy, no TC either.
20220722 - 0033:   pretty destructive it seems. Back to the lesser kick
20220722 - 0034:   Gone
20220722 - 0035:   Crazy still. Go to 100 thold
20220722 - 0036:   Crazy stilll. Real crazy looking
20220722 - 0037:   try no kick
20220722 - 0040:   Nice condenste, yep
20220722 - 0043:   Smaller kick, 3.9
20220722 - 0046:   Slight tilt, but no axial mode. increase kick 3.85
20220722 - 0048:   Smilar as before
20220722 - 0049:   let's go to decompressed and make condensates, and then kick there.
20220722 - 0069:   Changed the curves massively, would be surprised it anything works. This is at 25 seconds. Mainly, I made it much steeper in the begining
20220722 - 0071:   Alright, still here even with the sharp slope
20220722 - 0074:   Started the list here.
20220722 - 0097:   Condensate here as well
20220722 - 0098:   Showing a little bit here.
20220722 - 0099:   Empty. Sped it up a bit.
20220722 - 0112:   NOthing, maybe the LN is out?
20220824 - 0051:   Might be just the thermal cloud but with like 30ms tof
20220824 - 0099:   With kick
20220825 - 0043:   Started the OAH, both beams.
20220825 - 0045:   Seems like the tof is a bit too large here. Little bit of absorption towards the center actually, even with tof of 30 ms
20220825 - 0049:   Better, it seems. But quite a bit noisy
20220825 - 0052:   Am for some reson it doesn't work
20220825 - 0053:   Empty, at 0 tof. Strange
20220825 - 0054:   And even emptier at 10ms tof
20220825 - 0055:   Lasers unlocked, so no condensates.
20220825 - 0057:   Ooh, a little speck, how pretty. At 10ms tof that as well. Quite amazing
20220825 - 0062:   what is going on here.
20220825 - 0065:   Multi loop, 20 images
20220825 - 0067:   I was turning off the MT after the first image. Explains what we are seeing.Something is off with those images, constantly.
20220825 - 0068:   Same story. Hm, odd
20220825 - 0069:   Gone after the first image
20220825 - 0071:   Maybe because I also turn the comp coils off after the first image. Has to be.
20220825 - 0074:   Still the same issue. Perhaps it is blasting it with MOT XY beam, which we typically do to destroy the condensate at the end. Gotta be it.
20220825 - 0075:   Nice, better. This works
20220825 - 0078:   Those are all taken with about half a second between shots, starting after 65s of cooling. Let's go to about 68. And perhaps even more.
20220825 - 0079:   Nice, a transition towards the end. Go bigger? Why not.
20220825 - 0081:   Right. Next one, 50 images, 0.2 seconds inbetween, and starting at 70 seconds cooling.
20220825 - 0088:   Added a cheeky kick before cooling, but that is still when the cloud is warm
20220825 - 0089:   Let's check do the cooling, and then take 50 images, 2 ms, and image through it.
20220825 - 0090:   Some shit stuff again. Shapes are wrong when processing? Some sort of a weird bug. Not sure what the issue is.
20220825 - 0091:   Hm okay, wrong pulses. Let's do it again.
20220825 - 0092:   Problem with pulses.
20220825 - 0093:   Still wrong.
20220825 - 0099:   Still wrong
20220825 - 0104:   Still Wrong. Try something else.
20220825 - 0107:   Hm, still wrong, but now a narrower strip. How to fix that?
20220825 - 0111:   Multiplied all variables used in 100 width by three, to use it for 300 width haha. Wonder if that would work. Surely its all linear.
20220825 - 0114:   Mm cool cool, but now there is a slight edge on the sides. Let's fix that - increasing the exposure time?
20220825 - 0117:   Still bad.
20220825 - 0120:   Even worse
20220825 - 0131:   Roughyl okay - but the first image is poor.
20220825 - 0135:   Lasers got unlocked, but the pulses more or less fine. Mot seems particularly week, let's check the powers.
20220825 - 0137:   nicee, kick did its thing
20220825 - 0148:   Perhaps a bit too much cooling? Let's go back to 80
20220825 - 0149:   Very nice
20220829 - 0000:   Not an actual tof, forgot to disable the coils during the step.
20220829 - 0002:   Ugh smoll boi
20220829 - 0144:   Great condensates.
20220829 - 0157:   lost it
20220831 - 0128:   decomp not working
20220831 - 0161:   Try to optimize the Zeeman beam direction
20220831 - 0163:   V +1x
20220831 - 0169:   V +1x
20220831 - 0177:   
20220831 - 0178:   Hard to say. V +1x
20220831 - 0183:   V +2x
20220831 - 0186:   seems wrong way. Lets go other way
20220831 - 0191:   -V x4
20220901 - 0011:   Oh shit, low particle number, let's hope its LN
20220901 - 0023:   Kinda stable I guess, perhaps we can go a bit CCW in vertical and try to optimize that?
20220901 - 0029:   Still rising actually
20220901 - 0057:   Kicking it here.
20220901 - 0058:   And investigating the effects of waiting longer or shorter
20220901 - 0061:   no tc
20220901 - 0102:   Whoa. Realigned the lasers, got this. Damn.
20220901 - 0107:   Nice, back to condies
20220901 - 0111:   Nice. Let's kick around
20220901 - 0112:   Almost full condensate. Looks pretty big
20220901 - 0113:   With a kick, but without any new features. Check the difference between no kick and with kick
20220901 - 0116:   No kick - seems like not much difference with or without kick
20220901 - 0121:   Let's try massive kick.
20220901 - 0122:   can tell this is with a kick
20220901 - 0123:   Maybe some sort of a mode there? Let's check next ms
20220901 - 0124:   and next ms
20220901 - 0125:   seems a bit too high perhaps?
20220901 - 0126:   yep yep, dynamics on a ms scale.
20220901 - 0127:   no axial
20220901 - 0139:   tried with way less of a kick. Bleh, lets go to OAH.
20220901 - 0144:   Huh
20220901 - 0146:   Woah, moved a bunch
20220901 - 0147:   dissapearing?
20220901 - 0149:   It's gone, let's go inspect/
20220901 - 0150:   Woah with a little brother.
20220901 - 0151:   Wuf funky
20220901 - 0158:   Not much success with axial mode
20220901 - 0161:   No axial.
20220901 - 0165:   Nothing, let's call it
20220902 - 0011:   Farily stable. Let's cool down some more.
20220902 - 0018:   particle count OK
20220902 - 0020:   60+16s cooling
20220902 - 0021:   we are starting with a larger number of particles than before, so perhaps we might need to alter the curves a slightly bit to compensate for that? -yea, we shouldnt lose this many particles in the thermal cloud
20220902 - 0022:   It seems almost like we are cooling too quickly, too fast? Like the trap depth has lowered? So maybe raising the curves towards the end? If that makes sense, I'm not 100%, just try things. And don't make too big changes I'd say, it's still fairly sensitive. I copied the curve to RF2 Jillis DECOMP, ill play around with it
20220902 - 0023:   3s cooling
20220902 - 0024:   we are loosing about 25% or more of the particles in the first 3 seconds, I think we should focus here first
20220902 - 0030:   almost pure condensate at 18 s! Increase the tof
20220902 - 0031:   Looks decent, I havent changed the curve yet. Ill try 19s cooling first.
20220902 - 0033:   19s still
20220902 - 0034:   20s, workable?
20220902 - 0035:   20s, losing it
20220902 - 0036:   Let's make some time crystals. OK
20220902 - 0037:   its a bit unstable though, reducing to 19.5s. should give comparable numbers.
20220902 - 0039:   Have i lost the condensate or is the fitting bad due to low TOF? Bad fitting. 20 tof would spread out the thermal cloud way more. this is 20ms!
20220902 - 0040:   this is 0 TOF, with Kick. Funky, take a few more of those, lets see what's going on. Maybe with different wait times. OK, this is 25ms after kick.
20220902 - 0041:   its gone. Make increments also of 1ms - thhis seems to be the dynamics. could we try OAH for the first 50ms?
20220902 - 0042:   yep, let's do that after lunch. just make a list of something interesting to run through lunch, after we go to OAH. Ok, I.ll see if i can get that initial perturbation back, maybe with a bit more kick, and then setup a run with different waittimes.
20220902 - 0043:   there might be various effects when decreasing the kick - remember, we don't want it to move too much, we only want to induce the breathing mode, which then couples to axial. Ok
20220902 - 0044:   not much happening here, Im going to increase the trap depth a bit
20220902 - 0045:   there might be some oscillation? im going to iterate waittime and grab lunch. cool, nice
20220902 - 0052:   Woah one of those.
20220902 - 0053:   empty again, seems a bit unstable
20220902 - 0065:   hm, seems gone, let's try no kick
20220902 - 0067:   i think ok?
20220902 - 0072:   16s, condensate
20220902 - 0073:   16s
20220902 - 0075:   14s seems to be the sweet spot
20220902 - 0078:   yea, lets go with 14s. You should also play around with the optimal decomp time - I think now its set to 10, but 20 might be better ? don't know
20220902 - 0079:   Seems like it moved a lot? hmm, lets see the next one - maybe try less tof. Just to see. try also 0 tof. And then to cooling rf3
20220902 - 0080:   lets go back to 10 ms decomp, this looks worse
20220902 - 0081:   20 tof
20220902 - 0082:   Cool looks like it did before. Let's do cooling with tof. Once you have a condensate, go with kicking - use the current rf3 curve?
20220902 - 0083:   I'd advise you to try to find the depth of the trap (so where you lose the condensate), and then design a curve that drops you to that point (but of course stays above) - can i overwrite the rf3 trysome curve? yeah, or make a copy of it.
20220902 - 0084:   you need tof i know, i forgot
20220902 - 0087:   what is going on here?? is this with a kick? kick and tof, right? no kick - probabl the decomp acted as a kick of sorts.
20220902 - 0088:   condensate after 10s?? lekker. Go kickin - its wierd because untill now i didnt get a condensate with more then 12s cooling..
lets try repeating this first
20220902 - 0090:   yea, no condensate :( Almost looks like a condensate to me, with 20ms tof this should look way different? Perhaps not. Perhaps a bit more cooling. -ill try 12 and 14s again, im having doubts about the curve though, did you have results with this one?
20220902 - 0091:   sad
20220902 - 0092:   still sad
20220902 - 0093:   its tiny, but its a condensate (12s)
20220902 - 0098:   looks tiny, smaller kick? let it stabilize first k
20220902 - 0100:   :)   nice one! Here we go, back to time crystals - that looks like a crystal. shall i reduce the kick a bit? sounds good, or check the dependence on the wait time. Soon we should go to OAH.
20220902 - 0101:   Also before anything, just take an image at 0 tof. I just wanna see how it looks then -coming up
20220902 - 0103:   0 tof - hard to tell.
20220902 - 0105:   crystal is back, kickdepth at 3.875
If it remains stable at 3.87, lets go to OAH
20220902 - 0106:   gorgeous
20220902 - 0107:   very nice time crystal
20220902 - 0119:   go to OAH
20220902 - 0120:   something wrong
20220902 - 0124:   yeah kinda I guess
20220902 - 0129:   Woah great condensate image OAH
20220902 - 0136:   Very nice, finally
20220902 - 0139:   Tried changing the decompression amount to make it less. Didn't work at all - all empty.
20220902 - 0141:   no, all empty.
20220902 - 0146:   lost it
20220902 - 0148:   Nice
20220902 - 0149:   Nice mlti
20220902 - 0150:   Very nice
20220902 - 0151:   empty, strong kick
20220902 - 0152:   there is something here
20220902 - 0153:   smaller kick, lost it
20220902 - 0154:   nothing
20220902 - 0155:   help
20220902 - 0156:   Uf are lasers fine? Hm looks pretty okay
20220902 - 0157:   lonely shot
20220902 - 0158:   this is 3.9 kick, still lost it - try no kick?
20220902 - 0159:   its back
20220902 - 0167:   this is nice, 3.87V
20220902 - 0170:   bleh
20220902 - 0171:   nice! 3.86V kick
20220906 - 0062:   Nice, decompression worked, the center seems still at the same place. Let's cool this and make TC's
20220906 - 0064:   Ugh lost it?
20220906 - 0067:   Clearly the cooling curves dont work.
20220906 - 0071:   Lol, I didnt change the RF group to the correct one really
20220906 - 0099:   Okay, let's make some time crystals
20220906 - 0100:   Tiny boy though
20220906 - 0101:   Axial mode is there
20220906 - 0111:   axialll but also jumpy
20220906 - 0113:   Let's check at 0 tof if worth going to OAH
20220906 - 0114:   Ugh this is quite a bit sad. Make a list of in-time measurements
20220906 - 0154:   I mean something is there on the top right but eh
20220906 - 0159:   It feels like we should have more luck here than in the other decompressed trap
20220906 - 0162:   Ugh seems like the probe AOM doesn't work? God
20220915 - 0009:   bit on the low side
20220915 - 0022:   empty.
20220915 - 0026:   Okay okay, where we left it. Let's try to make some TC's
20220915 - 0099:   Full condensed
20220915 - 0108:   I guess decomp while condensed, or lasers unlocked
20220915 - 0138:   changing rft2 time
20220915 - 0140:   30M particles, we can work with that
20220915 - 0143:   20M particles at 16s
20220915 - 0147:   looks like we are loosing particles between 16-18s of cooling, but not reducing the temperature
20220915 - 0157:   doesnt look like a condensate? lets see if I can get a clear one before decomp
20220915 - 0165:   eyyy condensate
20220915 - 0168:   not much left there
20220915 - 0173:   wayyy beter, changed MOT ramp during decomp
20220915 - 0177:   doesnt look like bec, is the rf3 curve out of whack?
20220915 - 0179:   changed rf3 curve
20220915 - 0183:   before decomp
20220915 - 0184:   after decomp, looks good.
20220920 - 0000:   Needs nitrogen
20220920 - 0053:   getting there
20220920 - 0072:   decomp
20220920 - 0075:   start cooling
20220920 - 0136:   Maybe just over the limit, a tiny bit, in terms of the curves
20220920 - 0139:   I mean this looks pretty decent.
20220920 - 0141:   Starting to disspear again.
20220920 - 0151:   Beetje klein
20220920 - 0153:   Looks better
20220920 - 0154:   Again doesn't
20220920 - 0155:   Again, but I don't get it, I'm cooling it less, but it seems as if I'm cooling away more. Hmm. Maybe my logic is off? No, surely not that.
20220920 - 0156:   Let's try a second less of cooling. Also wouldn't be surprised if lasers drifted a bit
20220920 - 0158:   Yeah, for sure not enough. Let's try 22s cooling. So more than before.
20220920 - 0162:   Even worsee
20220920 - 0167:   Oh come on. Let's go check the laser powers.
20220920 - 0172:   Still shit.
20220920 - 0175:   Maybe a bit better? Let's see.
20220920 - 0177:   not good not good at all
20220920 - 0189:   alright, transition around here already. Lets go from here more or less linearly
20220920 - 0191:   Maybe cooled too much
20220920 - 0194:   idk, seems a bit better? Try with a kick.
20220920 - 0206:   Bullshittt
20220920 - 0211:   ratio of 0 tof condensate seems fine, but a bit cheap on the particle nubmer still. :/ tomorrow.
20220921 - 0016:   Ehh shitt
20220921 - 0017:   Ugh, let's optimize a bit more. Let's double check the LN flow, and then I guess let's try the alignment of the Zeeman beams and repump beam.
20220921 - 0022:   Rising?
20220921 - 0033:   Uf okay, dropping now. Possibly out of LN, but I mean, really? Comeon.
20220921 - 0049:   H CW
20220921 - 0052:   Seems like the wrong way. Let's got the other way.
20220921 - 0053:   H CCW
20220921 - 0054:   
20220921 - 0056:   H CCW
20220921 - 0067:   Jesuss, no atoms  V CW
20220921 - 0073:   V CW
20220921 - 0078:   LN out, don't trust those numbers too much .
20220921 - 0080:   Replaced LN
20220921 - 0082:   Gaining momentum.
20220921 - 0086:   Alright, le go optimizing
20220921 - 0088:   H CCW
20220921 - 0095:   H CCW
20220921 - 0098:   H CW
20220921 - 0101:   Woah dude coem on
20220921 - 0102:   Ughhhhh
20220921 - 0103:   H CW
20220921 - 0105:   Ughhh doesnt look good this. Bruh
20220921 - 0108:   Argh, let's go CCW agaub
20220921 - 0110:   Whatt where are all the atoms. LN is flowing.
20220921 - 0114:   Low but faily stable.
20220921 - 0117:   More CCW
20220921 - 0120:   Dude come on lets' go back CW
20220921 - 0121:   Let's try something else, perhaps the AOM is triggering too quickly or somethng -> increase loading time to 20s.
20220921 - 0123:   What the fuckkk
20220921 - 0125:   realigned the lasers, Zeeman from 125 - 135, let's see if that makes a difference.
20220921 - 0127:   Oh come oonnnnnnnnnnnnnn
20220921 - 0134:   H CW
20220921 - 0141:   V CCW
20220921 - 0144:   Epic
20220921 - 0148:   First improvement of the day really. Cool cool .
20220921 - 0149:   V CCW a bit more.
20220921 - 0159:   V CCW while at it
20220922 - 0007:   Ohh nice . Let's quickly check for last improvements in Zemaan vertical, and then MOT Repump.
20220922 - 0010:   V CCW
20220922 - 0015:   V CCW
20220922 - 0019:   V CCW
20220922 - 0022:   
20220922 - 0023:   V CCW
20220922 - 0025:   Seems too far.
20220922 - 0026:   Out of LN actually.
20220922 - 0043:   condensate
20220922 - 0044:   what the heck?
20220922 - 0045:   ok particle number is back up, no idea what happend there
20220922 - 0046:   
20220922 - 0047:   after decomp
20220922 - 0048:   after decomp
20220922 - 0050:   after decomp
20220922 - 0051:   after decomp
20220922 - 0052:   before decomp, bec
20220922 - 0053:   okay, 16s is to much
20220922 - 0056:   30M-ish before decomp
20220922 - 0057:   decomp
20220922 - 0059:   mot is empty, lost laser lock
20220922 - 0090:   empty
20220922 - 0098:   Lekker actually - better
20220926 - 0012:   Zeeman coils failed? There seems to be no cooling swtiching :/
20220926 - 0028:   All those with light on. Don't trust
20220927 - 0014:   No LN
20220927 - 0022:   Let's cool down to BEC's This looks promising though.
20220927 - 0031:   Lost it, even at lower times. Perhaps out of LN. Let's check
20220927 - 0040:   Cool cool! It's there. Just the cooling seems to be problematic
20220927 - 0052:   After changing the curves
20220927 - 0069:   Lekker. But only about a million in a condensate. Let's improve on that.
20220927 - 0071:   Nice. A bit small, but coolio. Let's give it a kick.
20220927 - 0074:   Ugh
20220927 - 0079:   starting to look sad. Maybe out of LN. Try no kick, no RF3
20220927 - 0081:   yeah way worse than before.
20220928 - 0013:   Ugh forgot the camera cover
20220928 - 0019:   Excuse you?
20220928 - 0020:   Alright, let's make some time crystals
20220928 - 0021:   Let's go with RF2 and decompression
20220928 - 0022:   Looking not too shabby.
20220928 - 0024:   Hm, a bit on the small side, let's check just before decompression
20220928 - 0025:   That looks good more or less I guess.
20220928 - 0030:   Getting smaller the number. Seems like I had more yesterday. Maybe the curves not as suitable?
20220928 - 0032:   Better, but then not sure if just because less cooling. I imagine.
20220928 - 0044:   Getting there but feels like I'm loosing it quickly
20220928 - 0045:   Why does the image feel so noisy?
20220928 - 0046:   Nice nice
20220928 - 0047:   Nice
20220928 - 0049:   No tof, just to see how it looks like. Although nice, it's a bit small unfortunatelly. Back to tof
20220928 - 0055:   Kinda condensed, yeah. But small.
20220928 - 0057:   Let's try to optimize the curves a bit more.
20220928 - 0062:   Ugh :/ Losing it a bit
20220928 - 0064:   Maybe illumination time is not good? Try more t_light
20220928 - 0067:   Let's run it few times at 5s cooling. Then change the curves and check if improvement or not.
20220928 - 0069:   Let's also just schedule a whole run of cooling, over the next half an hour.
20220928 - 0073:   Well this seems way too low for 62 s of cooling
20220928 - 0083:   Lets check 60s
20220928 - 0084:   Check laser powers. powers a bit low, lets' try again
20220928 - 0086:   Fairly stable
20220928 - 0087:   But a bit low
20220928 - 0089:   oo lekker ding. Let's go straight to time crystals
20220928 - 0096:   Yesss - Def a kick and def a time crystal - well the axial mode is there. Lekker ding!! Trying and looping through different kicks now
20220928 - 0097:   Time crystal
20220928 - 0098:   Also with lower kicks. Let's see until when we are seeing it.
20220928 - 0100:   Hm, not here anymore.
20220928 - 0101:   Nothing, but also it seems like more thermal cloud :/
20220928 - 0102:   Yeah, gone.
20220928 - 0103:   Gone
20220928 - 0104:   Nicee, back at it. Kick 3.8
20220928 - 0112:   Let's check the motion by varying the thold by 1 ms.
20220928 - 0115:   Nope, cannot tell, possibly too optically dense.
20220928 - 0123:   Smol though
20220928 - 0129:   shit, dissapeard. Why? Ln? Gotta be lasers drifting again?
20220929 - 0013:   Ughh small particle number :( Probably because low laser powers, I only had something like 125mW in Zeeman. Not sufficient it seems. What's the solution? Realign it all? Now or after the AMO, seems better to do it then.
20220929 - 0016:   Going nowhere with this.
20220929 - 0021:   Sometimes in the afternoon the lasers just become more powerful haha, no clue why that could be. Perhaps I'm more careful with second realignment? I'll just keep it running for a bit, to see.
20220929 - 0038:   RF2 + decomp
20220929 - 0040:   This looks extremely sad
20220929 - 0042:   Nah this is not gonna work
20220929 - 0058:   extremely sad. Let's recirculate
20220929 - 0061:   Oh. Alright. I guess better -> I have locked the lasers a bit more towards the center of the slope transition.
20220929 - 0062:   Eh. Fine. Calling it and doing the recirc.
20221013 - 0003:   Damn, pretty good. let's optimize the zeeman mirror though, I moved it because it moved, and I doubt I placed it perfectly
20221013 - 0004:   Oh my gooodnesss. Where did you come from. What on earth is going on. Also to keep in mind, I recirced after a while and optimized the Zeeman laser power to roughly 150 mW
20221013 - 0005:   Let's go optimizing. HORIZONTAL.
20221013 - 0006:   H - 1xCCW
20221013 - 0008:   uf this is making me happy
20221013 - 0009:   H 1xCCW
20221013 - 0013:   H 1xCCW
20221013 - 0016:   Let's go other way.
20221013 - 0019:   let's go back H 1xCW
20221013 - 0023:   Let's go vertical. VCCW
20221013 - 0025:   Hm, seems wrong.
20221013 - 0026:   V CW
20221013 - 0029:   V CW
20221013 - 0034:   V CW
20221013 - 0042:   Woah. lets do one more, V CW. Here we go. Come on 500M
20221013 - 0045:   Lekker ding, seems to go the right way.
20221013 - 0046:   Woah <3 <3 <3 <3 Moreee V CW
20221013 - 0054:   V CW
20221013 - 0057:   Oh we go higher
20221013 - 0060:   V CW
20221013 - 0063:   V 1CW
20221013 - 0066:   Okay, seems like the limit, or overheating AOm or something. Call it here.
20221102 - 0019:   Silliness here on.
20221103 - 0001:   Nitrogen still stabilizing
20221103 - 0005:   Getting there
20221103 - 0007:   Well shiiit
20221103 - 0020:   Pretty wild.
20221103 - 0023:   No way, it's here. Small, but here. Seems like too much cooling. Let's less cool.
20221103 - 0024:   Empty
20221103 - 0025:   Empty.
20221103 - 0026:   Oh man what an idiot. I didn't change the curve actually.
20221103 - 0031:   
20221103 - 0032:   This is with the old curve - looks good, at about 18s of cooling. Could be possibly better optimized
20221103 - 0033:   Okay okay. But this is with the same amout of cooling, as before. Roughly should be at the same frequency?
20221103 - 0034:   Okay so it's not with the same freqency of course, the other curve is exponential
20221103 - 0039:   Gone.
20221103 - 0043:   Sexy. This is with linear ramp, at 24 seconds (at some frequency, should check).
20221103 - 0044:   gone.
20221103 - 0048:   Around 23-25 seconds seems to be going through the transition. Maybe let's stretch those seconds a bit more?
20221103 - 0049:   Uf ulala. But a bit smaller than before
20221103 - 0052:   Go with a list
20221103 - 0071:   Should go with a bit more tof. Let's do that
20221103 - 0072:   It is  bit condensed, not gonna lie.
20221103 - 0073:   Just about condensed.
20221103 - 0075:   Woahh
20221103 - 0086:   Very nicee. 10M condensate, first one this season.
20221103 - 0090:   Yeah, gone here. Let's explore the interesting ones with more tof.
20221103 - 0092:   seems very dispersed. Maybe the condensate falls apart as well?
20221103 - 0096:   Some remnants here
20221103 - 0098:   Yoah, pretty cool
20221103 - 0101:   
20221103 - 0102:   Just before condensation, let's decompress here.
20221103 - 0104:   Let's cool down now to condensates again.
20221103 - 0118:   No LN
20221103 - 0121:   Lekker.
20221103 - 0122:   nice oness
20221103 - 0130:   Woah nice
20221103 - 0131:   Woah dude yess. let's go kicking
20221103 - 0133:   Oh fabulous, let's gooo
20221103 - 0134:   Epiccc!!
20221103 - 0135:   Well it moved a hella lot, but no axial mode. Let's try a bit later on, maybe we're just not seeing it here.
20221103 - 0136:   Also trying less tof, maybe it will be more apparent.
20221103 - 0137:   next one less tof
20221103 - 0140:   No mode.
20221103 - 0142:   Maybe needs a bigger kick since it's a bigger condensate. Does that work that way?
20221103 - 0143:   Maybe let's also try less tof, go to 10 - last time we saw it therr.
20221103 - 0145:   where did he goo? Oh just  the lasers.Should be fine now.
20221103 - 0146:   next one
20221103 - 0147:   Condensate here, no axial mode.Let's increase the kick. This is at 10ms tof, and nothing here. Kick at 3.815, going now to 3.805
20221103 - 0148:   Still no mode.
20221103 - 0149:   Still nothingg ugh
20221103 - 0151:   Nicee, now we're getting somewhere. Turns out it needed a weaker kick :o But time crystal!! Although, it does have a wild motion it seems.
20221103 - 0152:   Let's try a smaller kick, 3.835
20221103 - 0153:   Still there. Let's try to see slightly later on (1ms later)
20221103 - 0155:   Nothing here, let's check a ms before. Back to kick 3.825.
20221103 - 0158:   Betterr. try 1 ms less
20221103 - 0160:   Looks good looks good.
20221103 - 0161:   Looks decent. One ms less.
20221103 - 0164:   Ugh feels like I'm loosing ittt, it's getting smaller and smaller.
20221103 - 0165:   Let's try to 15ms tof. See if it increases the contrast
20221103 - 0167:   Yes, definetely worked. Very nice. Let's try even more, and also, I want to see a a lower kick so that it's less flying around business. Let's try 25 - although that might be pushing it.
20221103 - 0168:   Nice one. Also would be nice to check around if in the ms around it we have a better image.
20221103 - 0169:   Oh nice nice
20221103 - 0170:   3.
20221103 - 0171:   Ugh it's getting smaller and smaller, might be worth checking the laser powers.Let's check no kick.
20221103 - 0172:   Lasers did bring us some more atoms.
20221103 - 0173:   Yeah better but still a bit sad :/
20221103 - 0174:   Let's stop here.
20221108 - 0000:   25 ms tof, otherwise okay
20221108 - 0009:   A bit lower than last time. Let's check laser powers and LN flow
20221108 - 0043:   Mode but also very scissory
20221108 - 0044:   Lower the kick
20221108 - 0045:   Actually, let's schedule a "video sequence" - 1 ms spaced shots, to see how it moves. Soon. Not yet, let's check how weak of a kick we can use
20221108 - 0046:   Mode here, with a weaker kick
20221108 - 0047:   3.835. Still streched. Seems like it's moving quite a lot
20221108 - 0048:   3.845 Still here, seems similarly tilted. Pretty much the same, yeah.
20221108 - 0049:   3.855 - Still here, similar as before.
20221108 - 0050:   3.880 - I mean yeah, but maybe a bit fainter? Let's try something much stronger, seeing if it changes it.
20221108 - 0051:   3.800 - yeah I guess. Hm  Let's go even more extreme
20221108 - 0052:   3.750 - Seems quite a bit smaller, almost a bit destroyed, but the axial mode seems better
20221108 - 0053:   3.700 - Mode still, but stretchyy. Let's go the other way, go to 3.900, see how it's there
20221108 - 0054:   No mode visible, but the size better.
20221108 - 0055:   3.890 - Nice. Let's do a couple more here to see if reliable
20221108 - 0056:   still
20221108 - 0058:   Gone, but also it seems smaller.
20221108 - 0059:   Loosing ittt. Pause for few minutes and try again?
20221108 - 0060:   Ohhh possibly wihtout LN? Let's check
20221108 - 0061:   No mode here. Let's go to a safe 3.835 and check various wait times - video mode
20221108 - 0062:   Yikes.
20221108 - 0063:   No, nitrogen is fine. Mode here. Nice.
20221108 - 0072:   It seems relatively straight at roughly 11ms kick wait time, and it shows oscillations during the last 10 or so runs.
20221108 - 0073:   Lower tof - some axial mode, hardly seen though
20221108 - 0074:   Nicely seen axial mode. But it feels that the OD is too much and it's kinda hard to tell in the middle. Maybe time to go to OAH.
20221108 - 0075:   Mode, but optically thick. Checking at 0 tof to see the dimension of the cloud in situ
20221108 - 0076:   at 0 tof - about 300 px in size, about 800um in length. Let's go to OAH. Before that, maybe worth checking at condensation level once again, without a kick
20221108 - 0077:   Check at 25ms tof and no kick, then OAH
20221108 - 0079:   Ugh smaller than before, way smaller
20221108 - 0080:   Oh hold up,  maybe all is goody still ish. OAH and get time crystals.
20221108 - 0082:   Nothing to see here. This is  380 ms after the kick - according to Jasper roughly where we should start seeing the mode. Let's go a bit later on.
20221108 - 0084:   Still nothing here? Even at 560 ms after the kick. Let's go to even more, and then let's check where we left it off the last time - at 991 ms
20221108 - 0085:   No mode here. Go to 991ms after the kick. If it's not working, then I am super not understanding something. Bleh.
20221108 - 0086:   Ja ja, mode is here. Nice one, but it seems like it takes longer to appear than in Jasper's case. Lekker, let's go to OAH.
20221108 - 0088:   Empty?
20221108 - 0089:   Very neat! But no axial mode can be seen, unfortunatelly.
20221108 - 0090:   Great pic, but no axial mode visible. Maybe I could try with some expansion?
20221108 - 0091:   Ugh, why no axial mode? It feels like it should be here.
20221108 - 0092:   Eyy, maybe something here?
20221108 - 0095:   Let's compute the optimal focus - go to jupyter notebook. Let's run a list of different kick strengths, maybe we'll see it better here. But these images seem quite promising
20221108 - 0105:   Doing poor man's multi imaging
20221108 - 0119:   Feels like they are getting smaller and smaller, slowly dissapearing
20221108 - 0121:   
20221108 - 0125:   Let's try with a bit of tof. See where we're at. The thing is that small tof is unreliable, but too much might have too much of an effect on this. Let's give it a shot either way. Let's also check the LN levels.
20221108 - 0126:   with 3 ms tof, lower contrast, but still there. We should be able to see the density mode much better than this, right?
20221108 - 0127:   Let's check at 5 ms tof
20221108 - 0128:   This is already too much tof. I mean still visible, but nothing I feel can be inferred from this. Just for fun let's go to 10 ms tof, then back to good old in situ imaging.
20221108 - 0134:   Ugh this is no kick, still seems like some mode is present
20221108 - 0139:   Let's let it rest a bit.
20221108 - 0140:   Well almost gone
20221108 - 0141:   Yeah no this is bye bye. It's gotta be LN I think. Let's go check.  Yeah, LN empty. Ramped it up all the way, let's see if we can still get something
20221108 - 0143:   Nah is gone
20221108 - 0144:   Bleh
20221109 - 0001:   No tof, and only a thermal cloud at 60 seconds cooling, but can tell something is there. Nice!
20221109 - 0014:   RF2 comes in
20221109 - 0015:   Very nice. Started with RF2 here, getting denser and denser.
20221109 - 0016:   Nice. Let's raise the RF time and get to a condensed state. Then we can play around with tof as well.
20221109 - 0017:   Nice, better and better.
20221109 - 0018:   Condensate appearing.
20221109 - 0019:   Very nice
20221109 - 0020:   Nice. Let's just go straight to decompressed trap and take a list of shots, RF3 from 10 - 26s.
20221109 - 0034:   23 RF3 - seems to work very nicely, let's perhaps stop cooling at this point
20221109 - 0038:   Very nice. Let's kick here.
20221109 - 0040:   Let's go kicking - with a kick here, right?
20221109 - 0041:   With a kick, but cannot really see anthing :/
20221109 - 0043:   Nice, but hard to say if any mode is present here. Let's kick stronger
20221109 - 0044:   Faitner, let's go to a stronger kick - 3.825 -> 3.800
20221109 - 0045:   kick 3.800
20221109 - 0049:   Let's go to a higher kick - 3.845
20221109 - 0056:   Changing the kick doesn't seem to do much. But this looks nice
20221109 - 0061:   I don't see any difference :/
20221109 - 0063:   Hm. Let's kick it out of this world, like 3.515
20221109 - 0064:   Gone bye bye. Let's check 3.715
20221109 - 0066:   Almost too much at 3.715
20221109 - 0068:   Hm, maybe a bit modey here?
20221109 - 0070:   Hard to sya, but this is at 3.9 kick, where before we didn't see anything. Would be an idea to check at different times. Becuase here we're not considering any tof - that changes times, right? Oh true. Let's add on a cheeky 15 ms to the kick_wait_time - 891 -> 906
20221109 - 0071:   But then again, I did try yesterday to check differen times
20221109 - 0074:   Ughm loosing it.
20221109 - 0075:   Hard to say. Maybe I could try increasing the probe dosage?
20221109 - 0076:   seem non existent :/
20221109 - 0077:   Let's play with camera settings and then do a multi image loops.
20221109 - 0078:   Ugh I don't know man
20221109 - 0079:   Looks pretty sad :/ Let's make the frame smaller. We don't need all this space.
20221109 - 0080:   Looks good, but with the annoying line in the middle. I think we need to change something with the pulses. Let's experiment.
20221109 - 0081:   Try pulse 1.5
20221109 - 0082:   worse. Go the other way. Condensate almost gone though. Probably laser powers dropped.
20221109 - 0083:   This is better but now there are some artefacts near the edges. Let' try perhaps something in the middle. 1.35
20221109 - 0088:   Shitty :/  But the parameters are correct it seems for the pulses.
20221109 - 0089:   Those are without kicks. Just fyi. Let's implement also the second shutter.
20221109 - 0091:   Bitch, still doesn't work, the imaging loops. Let's check again.
20221109 - 0093:   Still, same issue with the imageloops.
20221109 - 0094:   Alright, so I also changed the width of the image, and it cuts it away from the right side. Oh I think I see what's going on there with the image loops.
20221109 - 0095:   Alright, now it should work I think
20221110 - 0005:   Great, we're running
20221110 - 0007:   NIce. This is just RF2, till condensaion. Let's decompress and kick
20221110 - 0008:   For some reason .fits (just the reference beam) gives me a silly image, although nothing really is different than e.g. just the probe one
20221110 - 0009:   Nice. Would be nice if this was with a kick actually haha
20221110 - 0011:   Let's go with 10 images in a series, first with no kick, then with a kick
20221110 - 0014:   Let's go with a kick
20221110 - 0016:   Oh hella nice TC I think. TIme resolution, 3ms. Check figure 4. Beautiful! TIme crystals!! Let's gooo. Or 0, 2, 4, 7 here
20221110 - 0017:   This is fabulous. Let's take like 100 shots or something crazy like that. Try to do refocusing on those, perhaps number 0 or 2 here.
20221110 - 0019:   !! 100 images OAH - kick 3.825
20221110 - 0020:   !! 100 images OAH - kick 3.825
20221110 - 0021:   !!!! 250 images OAH - same kick. Seems empty? Why, not nowww
20221110 - 0022:   !!!! 250 images OAH - same kick.     THE ONE     Seems to disspear a bit through imaging, which of ourse makes sense. It's less than a second so we don't expect the time itself to be the factor, but rather imaging being slightly destructive.
20221110 - 0023:   This one only has 10 images, but empty. :/
20221110 - 0024:   !!!! 250 images OAH - Lovely, starts disappearing
20221110 - 0025:   !!!! 250 images OAH - Very lovely
20221110 - 0026:   !!!! 250 images OAH - Lekkerrr dinggg 250, looks fabulous
20221110 - 0027:   2 IMAGE LOOPS - Analysis messed up because of two image loops, but the imaging seems to work correctly Lets goo epic stuff. This is with 60 ms inbetween the two loops (or actually 64 to be precise). 2x1 images.
20221110 - 0028:   2 IMAGE LOOPS 2x25 images 604 ms between loops.
20221110 - 0029:   2 IMAGE LOOPS  - All those have a 604 ms inbetween shots.
20221110 - 0030:   2 IMAGE LOOPS
20221110 - 0031:   2 IMAGE LOOPS
20221110 - 0032:   2 IMAGE LOOPS - 2x25 images.
20221110 - 0033:   ! 2 IMAGE LOOPS 2x25 images, with 604 ms between the loops. This one looks quite good.
20221110 - 0034:   2 IMAGE LOOPS - 2x25 images, 604 ms between the loops. Not the best images.
20221110 - 0035:   2 IMAGE LOOPS - This still with 604 ms between the two loops. Next one, 1.404s. Not the best tbh.
20221110 - 0036:   !! 2 IMAGE LOOPS - Fabboulouss - with 1.404 s between the loops, it seems at firs that there is no mode in the second one.
20221110 - 0037:   2 IMAGE LOOPS - okayish
20221110 - 0038:   2 IMAGE LOOPS - Nice one as well
20221114 - 0007:   Ugh what?
20221114 - 0012:   Something seems to be wrong with saving the files?
20221114 - 0014:   For some reason 0.fits is empty. Let's check the other script. Why is atoms empty. Shutter closed? And why is the 5.fits, the reference only with an interference patter?
20221114 - 0015:   Bleh what the helllllllll
20221114 - 0016:   Some further down are fine, but something is messed up.
20221114 - 0017:   I restarted the logic box, that seemed to fix it, but what the hell, why?
20221114 - 0021:   Bitch, this first one is again a mess. What the hell!?
20221114 - 0022:   First image messed up again - maybe not enough time before taking the first image? Also condensates not really big :/
20221114 - 0024:   ~400 ms between loops, doens't seem to affect it much
20221114 - 0025:   Looks good, it seems that it doesn't like a low number of images :/ But this seems pretty decent. Next one with a kick.
20221114 - 0026:   Yeah for sure cyrstal here, right? Seems like we can crop to 200 as well.
20221114 - 0027:   Yeah can't really see it :/
20221114 - 0030:   Let's go to 200 px width, which should allow us to go down to 1.5 ms between shots.
20221114 - 0031:   Way off.
20221114 - 0032:   Try exposure time to 0.001
20221114 - 0033:   Woah this just looks okay haha. Let's try some more images, and perhaps lower the exposure time to its limit. Also not the biggest condensate.
20221114 - 0034:   Nice. Let's stick here actually.
20221114 - 0035:   Lekker. Let's now do the test, right? Two image loops, 25 images each, 2ms between the images, and a list of values until like 3 seconds of the time between the two image loops. In the meantime, focus on the analysis script.
20221114 - 0036:   Test runs still.
20221114 - 0037:   Test run
20221114 - 0038:   Go ! Ugh but it doesn't look too promising.
20221114 - 0039:   1st form the list
20221114 - 0047:   Looks very faint to be honest, don't see a nice axial mode :/
20221114 - 0049:   It looks more meh :/
20221114 - 0058:   Small, but still here. Disapearing
20221114 - 0060:   Just gone?
20221114 - 0062:   Just not here anymore. Lost it somewhere.
20221114 - 0063:   Try without a kick.
20221114 - 0068:   Yeah gone. Wonder what happened.
20221114 - 0069:   Lasers got unlocked. Try again.
20221114 - 0070:   Again
20221114 - 0073:   Not a good day for experimentation it seems.
20221114 - 0080:   
20221116 - 0004:   Possibly out of the frame lol
20221116 - 0007:   Odd. Ught I think it's the same issue with the files. It seems to give me problems with a single shot. Strange.
20221116 - 0008:   Oh maybe I just needed the image loop to be on. But this condensate doesn't look too tasty :/
20221116 - 0009:   Not ideal, ngl. Increased nitrogen flow, perhaps that helps?
20221116 - 0010:   not good :/ Let's maybe image through cooling.
20221116 - 0011:   Let's image through the cooling. After 13 seconds RF3 cooling we go to imaging, and we take 20 images with half a second in between, so we should be imaging from 13-23 seconds of cooling. Hopefully.
20221116 - 0018:   Mm okay okay Cooling shots.
20221116 - 0019:   Okay, let's go 40 images with 250ms between shots and imaging 15-25 seconds cooling
20221116 - 0028:   Ugh I don't know really, doesn't look too promising. Let's try a kick
20221116 - 0029:   Forgot to put back rf3
20221116 - 0037:   Ugh, so hard to tell. This is not a good picture, also doesn't seem like we have good condensates.
20221116 - 0038:   Let's just take a couple more.
20221116 - 0043:   Bljehhhh
20221125 - 0001:   Hmm, low on particle nomber
20221125 - 0053:   getting worse and worse, the image on the tv looks abysmal as well
20221128 - 0014:   H 1x CW -> +1
20221128 - 0017:   Doesn't seem too good. Perhaps the wrong way.
20221128 - 0018:   H CCW  2x -> -1
20221128 - 0020:   Alright, perhaps it's rising a bit
20221128 - 0021:   Yeah, this seems to be the way
20221128 - 0022:   H CCW 1x -> -2
20221128 - 0023:   Ugh why lowerrr, that makes no sense. This is at the same parameters as before, with all the 260M images.
20221128 - 0025:   Maybe more?
20221128 - 0026:   H CCW 1x -> -3
20221128 - 0027:   No improvement. Try more?
20221128 - 0028:   No, worse, for sure, right? Perhaps get H back to 0, and switch to vertical. I expected more gains there anyway.
20221128 - 0029:   Ughhhhhh alwayssssss. Just when I move it and I give up a good one comes up. Surely this cannot be physical.
20221128 - 0030:   Ugh. I don't like this. Let's go to vertical.
20221128 - 0031:   Let's go vertical. V 1x CW + 1
20221128 - 0034:   Oh and don't freak out if you see me writting here. I also have access to this. SpookkkyyyEven better than whatsapp!!
20221128 - 0038:   +1 twist cw vert
20221128 - 0042:   +1 cw vert
20221128 - 0046:   +1 cw vert
20221128 - 0049:   +1 CW (will be turning a bit less in each turn from now on) vert
20221128 - 0053:   +1 cw vert
20221128 - 0056:   +1 cw vert
20221128 - 0059:   +1 cw vert
20221128 - 0063:   +1 CW Vert
20221128 - 0066:   
20221128 - 0067:   Goes up 40M while nothing was changed
20221128 - 0068:   Let's try something. There's a possibility that the AOM's are overheating, so let's increase the loading time, to see if that might help.
20221128 - 0069:   +1 cw vert
20221128 - 0070:   Uf the loading time is already at 20, should be fine, NtL: then ill just keep going
20221128 - 0072:   +1 cw vert
20221128 - 0080:   Going back CCW, white dot of the vert dial is now at ~4:30 o'clock
20221128 - 0084:   Turning further back CCW, WD at ~4 o'c
20221128 - 0085:   Still 4
20221128 - 0086:   Last at 4
20221128 - 0087:   Still going back to 3:30 o'clock
20221128 - 0088:   At 3:30
20221128 - 0090:   Last at 3:30 o'c
20221128 - 0091:   At 3:00 o'c
20221128 - 0092:   At 3:00 o'c
20221128 - 0093:   Last at 3:00 o'c
20221128 - 0096:   at 2:30 oc
20221128 - 0097:   at 2:30 oc
20221128 - 0098:   
20221128 - 0100:   turned ccw, wd now at ~2 o'c
20221128 - 0105:   Twisted it further back, white dot at about 2:15 o clock
20221128 - 0107:   Look's as if about 3 o'clock is the most promising, But I'll first dail back further
20221128 - 0110:   These are at 1 o'clock, Just to make sure that i dont need to dial i into that range any more
20221128 - 0114:   Going back to 'normal' values, so turning clockwise again from now on
20221128 - 0134:   White dot put at 3:00 o'c
20221130 - 0040:   Twisted the vert to 3:30 oc
20221130 - 0044:   Rotated a bit further verticaly, 3:45 oc
20221130 - 0045:   Nice, lets hope it stays here
20221130 - 0047:   Twisted a tiny bit further, clockwise
20221130 - 0051:   Good work
20221130 - 0052:   Tiny bit cw, might turn it a further in the next one. If it drops i'll dail is back ccw
20221130 - 0054:   
20221130 - 0057:   presumably, too far. Which is good.
20221130 - 0059:   Still quite nice,
20221130 - 0062:   Is that still all in vertical?
20221130 - 0078:   Dont worry, wanted a staring point
20221130 - 0079:   Fell free to  do bigger steps at the begiining. we'll do!
20221130 - 0090:   Okay this is really wierd, lets wait one more measurement
20221130 - 0101:   twisting the horizontal knob. Currently,  its at about 7:30 oc
20221130 - 0111:   Horz knob doesn't seem to be doing that much. Ill first try to optimise the vertical one. Then revert back
20221130 - 0114:   vertical put back at about 3 oc
20221130 - 0139:   Nice
20221130 - 0143:   Started turning the vertical knob of the mirrors, Will keep a log on paper.
20221130 - 0144:   Make sure to also log in here important things  <--
20221130 - 0152:   What's going on?
20221130 - 0153:   Don't go too far with that mirror. We should assume it's mostly optimal. Clear!
20221130 - 0155:   Too far, ill dail back
20221130 - 0165:   Went back to 12:00 again, Ill go further back ccw, to see what will happen
20221130 - 0168:   this was at 11:30 so i guess 12:00 is the best
20221130 - 0170:   This is at 11:50. so around the 12:00 is the place to be
20221201 - 0017:   UMMMM, lets wait for another measurement. I am keeping a journal on paper btw
20221201 - 0018:   This makes more sense.
20221201 - 0027:   Allright, Ignore
20221201 - 0028:   Also wierd, while nothing changed? No light etc
20221201 - 0030:   Will be turning vert dial back to 11, hope it gives normal values then
20221201 - 0031:   Seems this is just some random value, it doest look like a thermal cloud or anything
20221201 - 0032:   Turned it back to 11 oc vert, perhaps too farr back
20221201 - 0033:   What?? Nejc??
20221201 - 0038:   Nice!
20221201 - 0044:   Changed the horz knob, will slowly be turning back
20221201 - 0057:   nice!!
20221201 - 0065:   Its normal again luckily
20221201 - 0066:   
20221201 - 0070:   Nice, lets keep this up
20221201 - 0074:   May have went a bit too far, which is good
20221201 - 0086:   Grrr, this should be arounf 250-300m..... Lets wait for the next one
20221201 - 0087:   Wierd....
20221201 - 0091:   Very nice, hopefully the next one is good as wel, then ill do the vertical
20221201 - 0092:   NIce
20221201 - 0095:   Just gave the horizontal knob a ' big' twist, but it seemed to work?
20221201 - 0097:   I dailed the vert dial back even further ccw, to 3 oc. not much worse
20221201 - 0100:   Nice, dailed it down even further ccw, Now i have a starting point.
20221201 - 0119:   In the lab again, seeing some nice results in my absense, nitrogen seems to be almost through
20221201 - 0122:   Very nice, lets hope it stays here
20221201 - 0123:   Lets go. Let's goooooo
20221201 - 0124:   I dont get why all of the sudden its so unstable, I havent changed anything over the last 3 measurements. And the most unstable measurements were when i wasnt even here....
20221201 - 0129:   Nitrogen is done for. Ill get paul, But thats probably why these will be lower
20221201 - 0134:   First one with new N2
20221201 - 0135:   Fixing the flow of N2 now
20221201 - 0139:   Oh no
20221201 - 0147:   Come to think of it, while paul was rolling in the new LN he slightly touced/bumped into the laser table. Would this matter much?
20221201 - 0148:   This is terrible
20221201 - 0159:   basically nothing....
20221202 - 0013:   Ugh poor poor
20221202 - 0015:   Perhaps worth checking laser powers real quick
20221202 - 0034:   Start optimizing the MOT Repump
20221202 - 0035:   TOP CW
20221202 - 0042:   keeping a jounal on paper -
20221202 - 0046:   But also make sure to denote which things yielded the biggest improvements here !

20221202 - 0062:   
20221202 - 0065:   LN still flowing, Last measurement i shone the flashlight so dont worry
20221202 - 0073:   Im going too far, so from this one onwards ill slowly go back to the 'old'  position by rotating ccw
20221202 - 0082:   I did shine my flashlight while this was on, so lets have a look at the next one
20221202 - 0083:   This is with the white dot at about 5:30, hard so precisely see though
20221202 - 0116:   The top dial is at about 2 oc. Now i'l  do the bottom dial
20221202 - 0118:   Lekker we go, gave the bottom dial a really big change. it stood at 7 oc now at 3 oc
20221202 - 0120:   next run: bottom dial at 12:00 oc
20221202 - 0122:   Next run: Bottom dial even further: 9:00 oc
20221202 - 0127:   For this one i turned it back even furher, Might be a bit to far. Its now at 6oc a full ccw rotation from where we started
20221202 - 0130:   Oh rock and roll
20221202 - 0134:   Niceee!!!!
20221202 - 0145:   Turned the horz dial of the zeeman mirrior. But only by the tinniest of amounts. For this run it was at 3:50 oc. It used to be at 3:30 oc
20221202 - 0146:   Allright
20221202 - 0154:   Going back to the original position of 3:30 from now on
20221202 - 0159:

20221202 - 0190:   
20221202 - 0210:   Really cool. There seems to be a weird interference effect caused by the condensate? Funky.
20221202 - 0217:   Not really seeing anything time crystal wise.
20221202 - 0218:   
20221202 - 0222:   Looks like something is beginning to show
20221202 - 0225:   Really nice!! like ribbed chips - stealing that name for the paper
20221202 - 0226:   Nice, going to .5s incremements from now on
20221202 - 0239:   ughhh lost it, something weird happened - Zeeman shutter moved and blocked the beam. Fixed it
20221205 - 0032:   19 seconds RF2 seems to work best, just before the condensation.
20221205 - 0044:   Alright, nice nice
20221205 - 0048:   The're gone....
20221205 - 0054:   Crap, not sure what the issue is. It has to be in the script itself, MOT is still there.
20221205 - 0056:   Let's track back to where we lose it.
20221205 - 0068:   Ya boi, it's here. Let's play around.
20221205 - 0069:   Running it in random order. Hm, I dont like that though - let's do it normally.
20221205 - 0090:   Fainter, but still some mode. At this time we should see it though.
20221205 - 0091:   Ugh getting smaller and smaller. Also the mode seems to be gone, a tiny bit still there, but the condensate seems more or less gone
20221205 - 0093:   Cool cool. Its there, for sure. Let's keep this tof and vary wait_time from 760 - 770 ms
20221205 - 0122:   Ugh :/ Started looking a bit smaller and weaker. Let's check LN flow
20221205 - 0124:   The mode is still strong though. Sjut the condensates are getting weaker.
20221205 - 0139:   
20221205 - 0141:   beetje small
20221205 - 0142:   Hard to say, can't see any modes. Might be worth checking the other beam? Hmm
20221206 - 0012:   This doesn't seem correct ..
20221206 - 0028:   We're back baby!
20221206 - 0036:   RF2 = 19s, Rearly no condensate. Which is good.  Im assuming a N_cond of about 10K is neglidegble
20221206 - 0043:   A bit better, but still far below the values of 350+ mil that we want.
20221206 - 0044:   Yeah this isn't it i think. Ill try one again the vert one.
20221212 - 0015:   Didnt do anything so far, except LN is flowing
20221212 - 0021:   Ignore
20221212 - 0024:   All of these ' zeroes' happened after i turned the vert to 3 oc and vert remained at 6 oc. Hor used to be at 3:30 oc. Will be turning from to 3 to 3.30 oc in steps.
20221212 - 0047:   Twisted beyond 4 oc ,it becomes less, as expected
20221212 - 0051:   Turned it back to 3-4 OC
20221212 - 0059:   Twisted the hor knob to 7 OC, too far apperently so ill be turning it back ccw to 6 OC in increments of 20 min or so
20221212 - 0061:   A bit better after a slight tunr ccw
20221212 - 0065:   Kept turning it ccw towards the 6 oc position it was at at the start.
20221212 - 0087:   Not optimal, this is not just before the condensation. Try more tof
20221212 - 0091:   Forgot to change the camera settings.
20221212 - 0103:   Let's condense, please work.
20221212 - 0104:   Alright, cool stuff. Make a list to see how efficiently we are cooling. In absorption.
20221212 - 0116:   Seems like we are not quite at the lowest point yet, modify the curves or more time cooling?
20221212 - 0117:   Well, 26 seems too far. Let's just lower the curve ever so slightly at 25 seconds RF3.
20221212 - 0118:   Looks close to 100% to me.
20221212 - 0119:   Maybe not quite.
20221212 - 0120:   Oh but this is 24
20221212 - 0125:   Yeah, alright, this looks representative. A quick TC shot then OAH - first cooling, then kick at different temperatures.
20221212 - 0127:   Ohh lovely TC mode, fabulous. Let's go OAH.
20221212 - 0129:   ugh shit image. try no kick.
20221212 - 0132:   Crappppyyy, Maybe I could try with more probe power? Tru no kick
20221212 - 0133:   No kick workss hmm. Maybe try less time?
20221212 - 0134:   Alright, no kick works. Hm odd. Try less waiting time.
20221212 - 0135:   Mm okayish I guess. A bit less bright. Let's do cooling video.
20221212 - 0136:   Alright, next run we're taking 50 images, through the last 10 seconds of cooling (15 - 25s RF3)
20221212 - 0137:   Ugh not good, I might have forgoten something.
20221212 - 0139:   Huh, still no cooling?
20221212 - 0140:   Ohh, the RF3 time was set to well, rf3time varialbe, which was 15. Let's fix that and try again.
20221212 - 0141:   Yeah works but what the hell is with the image, seems so noisy. Let's hope next one is better.
20221212 - 0142:   Goodness me, yeah better but the condensate is barely visible.
20221212 - 0143:   Ughh crappy crappy. I don't like this one bit.
20221212 - 0144:   Not too enthusiastic about it but I guess it will have to do. Let's do one more with last 5 seconds of cooling.
20221212 - 0145:   !!! Ohh I like this one the most I guess
20221212 - 0146:   Last 5 seconds. Okayish, but it seems noisy again. Let me try increasing the probe dosage and try again.
20221212 - 0147:   !!! Oh this is lovely, very nice. Last 5 seconds cooling, 100ms in between shots.
20221212 - 0148:   !!! Yeah, higher probe dosage seems better.
20221212 - 0149:   Nice cooling sequence again. High probe dosages, but mm, okay I guess haha.
20221212 - 0150:   500 ms wait time after the kick, 2ms between the images.
20221212 - 0151:   Pff this looks close to impossible to fit :/
20221212 - 0152:   Ohh shit I see some axial stuff going on here. Let's keep pushing, nice mode as well. 
Let's make a list of doing exactly this at various RFs
20221212 - 0153:   Alright, here's the deal - next 5 runs will be at different rf3 times, from 20 to 25 seconds, and they will each have 250 images, with 2 ms in between the shots. Hopefully, we will be able to extract some useful stuff from that.
20221212 - 0154:   !! LOOP 1 - 20 - 26 seconds, 750 ms time after the kick, 2 ms between images, 250 images.
20221212 - 0155:   !! LOOP 1
20221212 - 0156:   !! LOOP 1
20221212 - 0157:   !! LOOP 1
20221212 - 0158:   !! LOOP 1
20221212 - 0159:   !! LOOP 1
20221212 - 0160:   !! LOOP 1
20221212 - 0161:   !! LOOP 2 - 20 - 26 seconds, 500 ms time after the kick, 2 ms between images, 250 images.
20221212 - 0162:   !! LOOP 2
20221212 - 0163:   !! LOOP 2
20221212 - 0164:   !! LOOP 2
20221212 - 0165:   !! LOOP 2
20221212 - 0166:   !! LOOP 2
20221212 - 0167:   !! LOOP 2
20221212 - 0168:   !! LOOP 3 - 20 - 26 seconds, 1000 ms time after the kick, 2 ms between images, 250 images.
20221212 - 0169:   !! LOOP 3
20221212 - 0170:   !! LOOP 3
20221212 - 0171:   !! LOOP 3
20221212 - 0172:   !! LOOP 3
20221212 - 0173:   !! LOOP 3
20221212 - 0174:   !! LOOP 3
20221212 - 0175:   100 images with 2 ms inbetween the shots. AFter 25 s RF3 and 1000ms wait time after kick.
20221212 - 0178:   Not good.
20221212 - 0179:   100 images with 4 ms inbetween the shots. After 750 ms of wait time
20221212 - 0180:   Not good
20221212 - 0184:   
20221212 - 0185:   100 images, taken 750 ms after the kick, imaged with 20 ms inbetween, so 2 seconds in total. Should give us a better idea perhaps over the damping without the imaging. Maybe, idk. Useful to have I guess.
20221212 - 0188:   Two imaging loops, 10 images each. Oh lovely, TC here for sure.
20221212 - 0189:   
20221212 - 0190:   !!! Let's try the modulation between the two loops. It feels so crazy far fetched, but maybe this is what I need in my life right now. Let's take many, and then let's take some without the modulation inbetween. This actually looks quite decent. Don't think I can see the axial mode after the modulation.
20221212 - 0191:   Modulation - 3.78
20221212 - 0192:   Modulation - 3.78
20221212 - 0193:   Modulation in between .
20221212 - 0194:   No modulation in between
20221212 - 0195:   No modulation- the rest the same
20221212 - 0196:   With modulation. This one was designed such that the time between the imaging loops should keep the axial mode in phase - 945ms of time inbetween, which is a mulitple of the period of axial mode of 1/95 ~ 10.5 ms. Right?
20221212 - 0197:   With modulation - 3.78
20221212 - 0198:   With modulation - 3.78
20221212 - 0199:   With modulation - 3.78
20221212 - 0200:   All the same. Let's start changing the modulations
20221212 - 0201:   Modulation 3.90 - T_0 = 1.32s, total wait time 1333.5 ms (should be in phase).
20221212 - 0202:   Modulation 3.90 - T_0 = 1.32s, total wait time 1333.5 ms (should be in phase). Let's keep everything the same, just increase number of frames to 25 per imaging loop.
20221212 - 0203:   Modulation 3.90 - T_0 = 1.32s, total wait time 1333.5 ms (should be in phase). 2x25 frames
20221212 - 0204:   Modulation 3.90 - T_0 = 1.32s, total wait time 1333.5 ms (should be in phase). 2x25 frames
20221212 - 0205:   Modulation 3.85 - T_0 = 0.88s, total wait time 0.8925 ms (should be in phase). 2x25 frames
20221212 - 0206:   Modulation 3.85 - T_0 = 0.88s, total wait time 0.8925 ms (should be in phase). 2x25 frames
20221212 - 0207:   Modulation 3.85 - T_0 = 0.88s, total wait time 0.8925 ms (should be in phase). 2x25 frames
20221212 - 0208:   Modulation 3.80 - T_0 = 0.66s, total wait time 0.672 ms (should be in phase). 2x25 frames
20221212 - 0209:   Modulation 3.80 - T_0 = 0.66s, total wait time 0.672 ms (should be in phase). 2x25 frames
20221212 - 0210:   Modulation 3.75 - T_0 = 0.529s, total wait time 0.546 ms (should be in phase). 2x25 frames
20221212 - 0211:   !! Oh this one is good. Modulation 3.75 - T_0 = 0.529s, total wait time 0.546 ms (should be in phase). 2x25 frames
20221212 - 0212:   !! Also fabulous. Modulation 3.75 - T_0 = 0.529s, total wait time 0.546 ms (should be in phase). 2x25 frames
20221212 - 0213:   !! Man these are starting to look better and better haha. Crazy. Modulation 3.70 - T_0 = 0.440s, total wait time 0.462 ms (should be in phase). 2x25 frames
20221212 - 0214:   !! Modulation 3.70 - T_0 = 0.440s, total wait time 0.462 ms (should be in phase). 2x25 frames
20221212 - 0215:   All with mod_length of 2+440+17+2 ms, looping through a range of mod_depths, 3.5 - 4.
20221212 - 0220:   Maybe some axial mode in the second part? Hard to say :/
20221212 - 0221:   !!!! Definetely axial mode in the second part. Maybbeeee they don't match, uff hard to say here. Would need fitting.
20221212 - 0225:   I think I can see some TC modes in the second loop.
20221212 - 0226:   The list we run now is varying the modulation length - all at 3.7 mod_depth - from 10 to 300 ms, in various steps. Always we ensure that the total time between the two loops is 315 ms, a mulitple of 10.5 s, which should leave us in phase).  -- Stil there, but doesn't seem to have any more axial mode.
20221212 - 0229:   Looks like axial mode disapears.
20221212 - 0231:   !!!! Epic stuff, definietely phase in the other half. This one might be one of the best ones.
20221212 - 0232:   Massive shift in position, and axial mode somehow visible.
20221212 - 0234:   !! Let's go back to the one which looked the best from the list. Yeah these look fantastic. Not sure if the phase changes though.
20221212 - 0235:   !!! Fantastic
20221212 - 0236:   !!! Looks great, wondering about the seocnd phase.
20221212 - 0237:   !!! The second axial mode very visible.
20221212 - 0238:   !! Amazing. Analyse those for sure.
20221212 - 0240:   Let's go to a bigger frequency shift 3.7 -> 3.6. Seems a bit worse actually.
20221212 - 0241:   Same as before.
20221212 - 0242:   Yeah for sure looks worse.
20221212 - 0243:   Modulation at 3.75 - Nah also not here.
20221212 - 0244:   Hm, odd, let's go back to 3.7 + 100ms modulation.
20221212 - 0245:   It's starting to look worse and worse I fear, and also it is 10 pm, so let's wrap up. Good day though.
20221212 - 0246:   Damn forget about that, this still looks good. But it is still pretty late, so had to call it for today. Very nice though, fingers crossed massively that tomorrow we have the same stuff.
20221212 - 0247:   Yeah it seems a tiny bit worse than before. Still looks good though. Axial mode on both sides though. It seems that the second one has a bigger dipole moment, interesting. Probably due to the kick.
20221213 - 0015:   Ugh, this is no fun :(
20221213 - 0017:   Ughh whatt the hell!?
20221213 - 0043:   LN is flowing as it should
20221213 - 0081:   Alrihgt, let's get some BEC's
20221213 - 0083:   Alright, this is straight up 23s RF3
20221213 - 0084:   Cool cool, where we expect it, kinda. Not the biggest, but it does the job. That's what she said.
20221213 - 0093:   Go to OAH
20221213 - 0094:   Two frames only, one before the modulation, one after the modulation
20221213 - 0099:   Frame 2 with 1 ms tof, maybe not actually, let me check if the coils are on then. Don't think so
20221213 - 0100:   Alrihgt, next one should be with some tof
20221213 - 0101:   1 ms tof
20221213 - 0103:   3 ms tof. Looks like it, yep
20221213 - 0105:   Even more tof
20221213 - 0106:   Alright, let's repeat yesterday's shots.
20221213 - 0109:   Those were all with 23 seconds cooling, let's go to 25
20221213 - 0110:   Perhaps too much cooling? Let's go to 24s
20221213 - 0115:   Yeah too much, let's go to 24s
20221213 - 0116:   Yeah looks better immediately.
20221213 - 0117:   empty
20221213 - 0121:   Not too good still :/
20221213 - 0131:   Shit stuff. Ungood.
20221213 - 0132:   Let's try no kick or something
20221213 - 0133:   Some issues with plotting, maybe the first image needs more time or something.
20221213 - 0136:   Ugh something is wrong, maybe the lasers?
20221213 - 0139:   So not the lasers, something else. The condensate is still here, just images look horrible.
20221213 - 0140:   strangeeeeee
20221213 - 0141:   empty
20221213 - 0142:   Empty
20221216 - 0054:   Cool cool. Try a TC and then OAH
20221216 - 0055:   
20221216 - 0056:   Empty. Bleh.
20221216 - 0063:   Great, let's go to OAH. First, let's double check the condensation fractions at each cooling time.
20221216 - 0070:   Good good so far.
20221216 - 0075:   Greatt. Let's go OAH after next one..
20221216 - 0076:   Pretty much pure condensate, no?
20221216 - 0081:   Alright, looks lovely.
20221216 - 0082:   1. LOOP :: Starting a loop here. Let's hope for better images this time.
20221216 - 0083:   2. More detailed, 250 images, through 750 ms. 3 ms between images. Should give us a longer time.
20221216 - 0084:   3.
20221216 - 0085:   4. Faint towards the end
20221216 - 0086:   5.
20221216 - 0087:   6. Good, all seem very destructive tho.
20221216 - 0088:   7. Good
20221216 - 0089:   8.
20221216 - 0090:   9.
20221216 - 0091:   Not good, a mess
20221216 - 0092:   11.
20221216 - 0093:   Not good.
20221216 - 0094:   12. I guess, but small
20221216 - 0095:   Not good
20221216 - 0096:   Good.
20221216 - 0097:   10. Good
20221216 - 0098:   Same bulshit
20221216 - 0100:   faint - last with 250 shots.
20221216 - 0101:   Empty. 50 shotss
20221216 - 0102:   Empty. Maybe too much cooling?
20221216 - 0103:   empty
20221216 - 0104:   Almost empty
20221216 - 0105:   Empty
20221216 - 0107:   Looking good - 5 ms between shots.
20221216 - 0108:   Looking good as well, same as the last shot
20221216 - 0109:   ONSET -- 250 images, 10 ms after the kick. Let's check the onset of the time crystal. Let's lower the probe dosage and try again.
20221216 - 0110:   ONSET -- Probe dosage lowered from 75 uW to 20 uW. Yeah, you can tell we lowered it I guess.
20221216 - 0111:   Out of LN. Let's replace it and see, now that we're at it
20221216 - 0112:   Two images only, just to see when we see it. Empty. Lasers messed up.
20221216 - 0113:   empty
20221216 - 0114:   empty, messy
20221216 - 0116:   still empty, but MOT is there. If the next one is empty I'm calling it a year.
20221216 - 0117:   Bye bitch. I'll put it to absorption imaging setup for future Nejc, you're welcome. Thanks past Nejc, you rule.
20230109 - 0010:   No atoms in MT
20230109 - 0029:   Still nothing. Will have to fix it tomorrow, still have to prepare for the course tomorrow.
20230109 - 0043:   What the actual hell, how does this workkk are you kidding me. Powers are low, I eyeballed the Zeeman beam, no LN flow here, AND YET, more than what we had before Christmas and all
20230109 - 0049:   I mean dude. A cheeky kick?
20230111 - 0031:   With the kick, but no axial mode. Let's try to wait longer.
20230111 - 0033:   Lol forgot to change the kick depth
20230111 - 0035:   Ma boy! It's here.
20230111 - 0038:   Cool cool - two images, check both
20230111 - 0039:   Two images, one before the modulation, one after (tried with tof, but forgot to turn off the coils in between). You can see the second image is a bit weaker.
20230111 - 0040:   Second one is as expected empty. It's gotta be the fact that we let it fly and then turn the coils back on. But alright, we can do the absorption imaging as well with two loops.
20230111 - 0041:   But no TC mode interestingly. I think we imaged before the onset. Let's change the wait time after the kick.
20230111 - 0042:   Ohh how cool is this
20230111 - 0044:   Yess, the mode is here.Let's increase slightly the RF3 curve as well, seems like we are not in the purest of condensations.
20230111 - 0045:   Oh super funkyyy it throws it like a motherfucker, pardon my language. This is without the PT modulatino though. Just due to the magnetic trap being released and then reapplied. Let's try smaller TOF1. But yeah, for sure TC mode visible.
20230111 - 0046:   Also, setting the tof2 to 0, to see what that gives us.
20230111 - 0047:   Can't see axial mode at 5 ms tof
20230111 - 0051:   Let's go to OAH
20230111 - 0056:   !! Fabulous, and with a very obvious jumo inbetween, surely due to the perturbation. Let's turn it off to see if that stops the jumpiness
20230111 - 0060:   A bit of a jump but nothing serious. Let's now full skip the time between the shots, but still start the PT modulation. See if that works.
20230111 - 0061:   !! Lovely axial mode appears. TC. Next one: no modulation or pre- or post- time, but we do start it - hopefully, we should be able to image through it (unless it remains at the value it is). 10 images, then modulation starts, then 100 images (200ms of imaging), modulation takes 150 ms. Funky, lets see.
20230111 - 0062:   Lovely axial mode.
20230111 - 0064:   It seems to have induced quite some motion I'd say. looks promising.
20230111 - 0073:   All empty because lasers got unlocked.
20230112 - 0003:   Still empty
20230112 - 0019:   Still all empty
20230112 - 0021:   Nothin still. Why is the multi imaging loop not working :(
20230112 - 0022:   Oh it just works or what? And with the mode - Very lovely though.
20230112 - 0030:   Why so faint?
20230112 - 0031:   A bit better. You can see a nice shift in position since we wait 150 ms and give it a kick in between. Let's do the same with more images, then change the PT modulation to the axial one.
20230112 - 0032:   Cool stuff. 50imgs, 50imgs, works. Some mode in the second loop, albeit smaller.
20230112 - 0033:   Cool, very nice.
20230112 - 0034:   Lovely, very pronounced mode
20230112 - 0036:   WITH AXIAL PT. Empty, but also the first loop is empty, which is odd.
20230112 - 0037:   Also empty.
20230112 - 0038:   /
20230112 - 0039:   /
20230112 - 0040:   /
20230112 - 0041:   Lasers got unlocked
20230112 - 0042:   !!! mmm delish! Very nice, the kick worked and we induced at least some breathing mode in the other direction.
20230112 - 0043:   Looks good actually. Not sure about the mode in the other loop, but hard to say since it's breathing
20230112 - 0044:   150 + 150 images, with the kick in between. Looks good. Let's go earlier on, before the onset of the crystal
20230112 - 0047:   Good but less good as 45
20230112 - 0048:   Getting fainter and fainter
20230112 - 0052:   Fainter
20230112 - 0054:   Empty - lasers unlocekd
20230112 - 0055:   /
20230112 - 0056:   /
20230112 - 0057:   /
20230112 - 0058:   /
20230112 - 0059:   /
20230112 - 0060:   /
20230113 - 0000:   First image messed up for some reason, perhaps not enough time before imaging
20230113 - 0001:   Second image seems fine
20230113 - 0003:   Yeah, that fixed it, but no condensate here. Makes senes, it's a bit early and the LN is probably not running fully.
20230113 - 0012:   Still empty, should slowly start to see something - maybe check for MOT?
20230113 - 0018:   Still all emty
20230113 - 0019:   Ugh
20230113 - 0021:   Hm very funky. It is here. It could be that the RF2 time was set to 22 seconds before, which might have ruined the condensate after expanding? Strangeee. Let's try again with this lower RF2 time, including RF3 time.
20230113 - 0022:   Still empty. So this wasn't the issue, let's lower the RF3 time, maybe too much cooling? From 24 -> 20s
20230113 - 0025:   Still nothing. Hate this. Let's just add the kick, see what happens.
20230113 - 0026:   Alright, it's here. Odd,this is still at the same parameters as before. Let's try slightly more cooling
20230113 - 0027:   Okay so didn't actually change anything. In two runs.
20230113 - 0030:   Alright, better!
20230113 - 0031:   Try more cooling
20230113 - 0038:   Yeah, better. It seems like there is some axial mode present, but hard to say for sure. No kick though, so shouldn't be. 24s RF3.
20230113 - 0039:   The second shot visibly shifted, as well there is a PT inbetween, still. The condensates do not seem to be super large unfortunatelly, so it might be tricky to detect (well) any TCs reliably.
20230113 - 0040:   Looks smaller. This is at 25s cooling, let's go back to 24 RF3. Might be worth checking with RF2 again. Next, with the kick.
20230113 - 0043:   Nothing in the second image either.
20230113 - 0044:   Nothing really showing here. Kick wait time at 400ms, which I believe should be too little
20230113 - 0045:   Fainter.
20230113 - 0047:   Yep, mode here for sure
20230113 - 0048:   Go to 18s rf2
20230113 - 0050:   Yeah, almost better. This is with 18s RF2 cooling. try less haha?
20230113 - 0051:   looks better, no?
20230113 - 0052:   Of course it;s worse all of a sudden for no reason. Go to RF2 17, just to check.
20230113 - 0053:   Try with less perturbation for the second part, and let's take some more images to see better. Let's do 10, 10? Easy for analysis and will give us some insight. Still 2ms between shots.
20230113 - 0054:   Cool cool, let's lower the PTP (phase transition perturbation) and take 20 images.
20230113 - 0055:   No mode seen in the second part
20230113 - 0056:   Try the PTP in other direction
20230113 - 0057:   Go to 18s RF2, and PTP back to 0.3 -> 0.2 -> 0.3
20230113 - 0058:   First mode yeah, second not so much
20230113 - 0060:   Looks like a smaller amplitude on the other side. Also trying next 23s RF3 and mod_length to 50ms. Same depth. After that, a loop and lunch.
20230113 - 0063:   Nice mode in the first half, second nothing, very elongated.Try to make it longer
20230113 - 0064:   Lovely. Mode in the first half, hard to say for the second half. Let's try to just turn off the PTP and see if we still have it at all anyway. This is with PTP 0.3 -> 0.02 -> 0.3, so quite a kick - in 50 ms as well. Next one the same but in 500 ms
20230113 - 0065:   U sexy - but the second one is of course messy. Let's try with 1 ms frames as well. On my to do list, but it will probably be outside the frame.
20230113 - 0066:   Okay, so no PTP here, 150ms in between the loops though - axial mode persists normally. Let's try 100 ms just for lolz.
20230113 - 0067:   mode here certainly. Thorughout.
20230113 - 0068:   Comes into the frame a tiny bit, but not enough. Ugh. What do we change to center it. MOT freqs? But all the times and pulses and all works nicely. Let's go to 200px and then fix the alignment of the probe beam
20230113 - 0069:   too much it seems.
20230113 - 0070:   Nope gone, maybe too much
20230113 - 0071:   Yooo epic and very visible at 3.7 kick. What the hell, this might be even better than what we had before.
20230113 - 0072:   Nice axial mode, very nice actually. Kick at 3.8
20230113 - 0073:   Looks big and bright, but no axial mode. Small oscillations, no mode since kick not strong enough.
20230113 - 0074:   Perfect. Exactly as expected, no kick -> remains still - this is the center we need to move to the center center
20230113 - 0075:   Tiny tiny bit clockwise - wrong way? Let's go the other way. Let's just hope that it's not soo much more sensitive than I thought. Otherwise we'll just increase the frame size
20230113 - 0076:   Better. Alright, let's go a tiny bit more this direction. Good good.
20230113 - 0077:   better and better, tiny bit more. Center at 117
20230113 - 0078:   uuu even better. Need to get the center to 90. 10 more pixels or so. Next one should be great, and we can go to 100px 1ms.
20230113 - 0079:   Bit more.
20230113 - 0080:   Alright, might be a bit low but let's kick it and see if we're within the frame
20230113 - 0081:   !!! Fantasticcc, all within the frame, looks fantastic. Also the axial mode, goodness me. Maybe we can do more images as well. And then with the PTP. This is really good, goodness.
20230113 - 0082:   !!! Oh this is just sick, this looks so good.
20230113 - 0083:   !!!!! ALL OF THE ABOVE and below
20230113 - 0084:   !!! Seems like we wait too long before imaging. There seems to be nothing on the other side. Also, let's go to fewer images this takes a bit long
20230113 - 0085:   Same as before, the first one works wonderfully, the other one not so much
20230113 - 0086:   Cool stuff, but no mode in the second one. Let's lower the amplitude until the mode remains, and then check
20230113 - 0087:   Let's first try to repeat what we had the last time, modulation in radial direction
20230113 - 0088:   Hm, okay this a mental PTP but it looks pretty normal. Huh
20230113 - 0089:   Yes boy, massive mode on both sides. Okay, let's just run this with 50 images on both sides until we get a good sequence, with nice modes showing on both sides. First, by modulating the radial trapping frequency:
20230113 - 0090:   Looks lovely, first part 7/10, second 4/10, barely visible ish ish
20230113 - 0091:   Similar as before, first part looks promising. Second one there is a little bit of the mode, but not really enough for the fits
20230113 - 0092:   Ugh similar as before. Perhaps a little bit better. Let's try to go to 3.75 So less of a perturbation.
20230113 - 0093:   I mean those are really nice OAH images of the time crystals
20230113 - 0094:   !!!! Mm interesting - we have a mode in the other one. Mode and mode
20230113 - 0095:   !!!! Lovely, but perhaps a bit fainter.
20230113 - 0096:   Seems to half dissapear, although there is a bit.
20230113 - 0097:   Fainter, not working. We cahgned the wrong kick parameter. 3.75 for the TC kick and 3.8 for PTP
20230113 - 0098:   Same as the previous one. I mean still the TC mode. Changed it now.
20230113 - 0099:   !!! Mode and mode, but fainter. But definetely modes in both sides.
20230113 - 0100:   Same, fainter. Try RF3 to 1s less, just for lolz.
20230113 - 0101:   !!! Good, a bit faint. But mode on both sides.
20230113 - 0102:   Yeah, similar to before. Let's see if lower RF3 makes a difference
20230113 - 0103:   It does make a difference, but for the worst. Back to higher RF times
20230113 - 0104:   Same as before
20230113 - 0105:   24 seconds -> not much better. Let's go check on the lasers.
20230113 - 0106:   /
20230113 - 0107:   /
20230113 - 0108:   !! Actualyl pretty nice. Mode on both sides, for sure.
20230113 - 0109:   !! Cool, now the same but with the axial kick. Axial kick worked, but no TC on the other side. Let's lower the kick.
20230113 - 0110:   yeh more or less as before. Let's lower 3 -> 1.5 -> 2 into 3 -> 2 -> 3 (x10^-1)
20230113 - 0113:   First half good, nothing in the second half
20230113 - 0114:   Same. First half good, second bad
20230113 - 0119:   Yeah getting fainter. Let's try something else. Let's try to go the other way with the kick, And also later, let's try to image through the perturbation or something.
20230113 - 0121:   Eh
20230113 - 0122:   faint - both
20230113 - 0124:   Yeah this is getting worse, might soon be time to call it.
20230113 - 0125:   Not getting any better.
20230113 - 0126:   Let's increase a bit the RF2 time
20230113 - 0127:   Neh
20230113 - 0128:   /
20230113 - 0129:   Nope, calling it. I'll go to absorption imaging and then I'll call it a day.
20230113 - 0130:   Nope
20230113 - 0132:   To absorption imaging.
20230113 - 0133:   Let' check at 60 s
20230113 - 0141:   All absorption but the code is silly and I can't fit yet the pnum. Let's take another one with a single image.
20230116 - 0010:   Feels more realistic, doesn't it. Although, probably no LN
20230116 - 0021:   Heey someone woke up
20230116 - 0045:   Increase RF3
20230116 - 0052:   Kewl, let's get a kick - then, imaging the TC from the start to finish -> like 400 ms to 900 ms, is 500 images too much? Ugh haha maybe a bit. Yolo right
20230116 - 0055:   TC mode present here, but it feels like too much cooling - or LN is out
20230116 - 0056:   Cool, nice, we have a TC here. Let's do a list to check where we start not having it.
20230116 - 0059:   Mm, doens't look like it's here. This is at 100ms I thnk .
20230116 - 0060:   100 and it is here
20230116 - 0067:   !!! What the hell is this - keep in mind, this is with extra 100 ms
20230116 - 0083:   
20230116 - 0090:   Oh bitch because I'm not kicking. Try again.
20230116 - 0091:   Ugh ugh
20230116 - 0092:   Bleh, still not as cool as it was. Let's go to OAH after this one. We might actually be out of LN now.
20230116 - 0095:   Just replaced the LN. Let it come back to 300ish, then OAH, then taking the monster one.
20230116 - 0124:   Seems a bit better than before, but not quite where I want it - let's go OAH, quick large one, and then see where we are.
20230116 - 0126:   Cool, nice. Let's go to OAH.
20230116 - 0127:   Ugh not as good as previous days :/
20230116 - 0129:   Forgot to turn off tof1 - so first loop is silly. Also this is 1 ms after the kick
20230116 - 0133:   Yeah, better. But still that weird line. Let's try something.
20230116 - 0134:   Definetely not.
20230116 - 0135:   Yess, much better. Let's go
20230116 - 0136:   Not sure if there's any TC mode here yet.
20230116 - 0137:   Alright you better get ready. This next one, 600 frames all together, it will surely take crazy amount of time to analyse, let's hope it can be done. It goes as follows: Kick, wait 100ms, take 300 images with 1.05 ms inbetween, then wait 300 ms, take 300 more images with 1.05 ms inbetween. Mental. I'm scared. Alright, crashed the computer, buffer underrun. Alright, let's try just 300+1 frame. Hopefully that's not too much. Still too much, let's try 250+1
20230116 - 0138:   that worked. Let's see it - This one is just empty. Bruh
20230116 - 0139:   Not the brightest. Let's take a couple until we get to a nice TC mode.
20230116 - 0140:   Similar, not the greatest dataset tbh.
20230116 - 0141:   /
20230116 - 0142:   TC mode here, surely.
20230116 - 0144:   Nice TC
20230116 - 0145:   Empty because we cut it
20230116 - 0146:   well actually it is here. Ugh super bright as well, and we didn't get it
20230116 - 0147:   Some TC - 2 ms inbetween thoug
20230116 - 0148:   !!! Increase kick_wait_time to 300. Fuck, it's good but also time inbetween is 2 ms
20230116 - 0149:   !! Good but time inbetween =2 ms
20230116 - 0150:   !! Nice but still 2 ms - but a great TC
20230116 - 0151:   !!! Beautiful! 1ms, 100 ms after the kick
20230116 - 0152:   !! Also nice, both ofthese last two with 1 ms time inbetween, and 100ms after the kick
20230116 - 0153:   !!! 1ms, 100 ms after the kick
20230116 - 0154:   Let's go 350 after the kick (next one), so it should continue where we stop with the previous one - not really actually, maybe a ms or so of difference because of the 0.05ms of the image time
20230116 - 0155:   !!! Very nice! Now 350 ms after the kick.
20230116 - 0156:   !!! --- Videos look good as well, might be an idea to also stabilize the frames. So we trully get just the breathing and the axial mode.
20230116 - 0157:   Lovely as well but less of a mode visible
20230116 - 0158:   !!!! Uf mama!
20230116 - 0159:   Cool. Not bad, not mama - kick_wait_time = 600
20230116 - 0160:   ! Epic, I think TC starts to dissapear a bit here.
20230116 - 0161:   !!! Very nice, TC still here and kicking
20230116 - 0162:   Smaller baby
20230116 - 0163:   !! Smallish but very pronounced
20230116 - 0164:   Similar as the previous one
20230116 - 0165:   Smally
20230116 - 0166:   !! Kewl, best of the two. Still TC mode, even after a second. Let's try after a second and a half
20230116 - 0167:   ALmost gone
20230116 - 0168:   Still here but almost gone
20230117 - 0000:   Camera troubleshooting day. Let's check why we cannot take more than a certain number of images
20230117 - 0008:   All stop at 510 images taken. Interestimg/
20230117 - 0009:   X size makes no difference. those are at 2000px, the one above at 100.
20230117 - 0010:   Alright, so the same when on tty or when on terminal in gui
20230118 - 0044:   
20230118 - 0050:   Empty.
20230118 - 0054:   Empty again.
20230118 - 0055:   
20230118 - 0076:   
20230118 - 0078:   same paramters as 0076 but 7%
20230118 - 0094:   
20230124 - 0038:   Nothing, let's make the trap deeper. 5V - should be around 80mW of IR power, which should be enough, according to thesis by Wouter. Otherwise, we can just ramp up thepower to see if that's the problem
20230124 - 0039:   I might be imagining things, but is there something there?
20230124 - 0041:   It seems like I was imagining it :/ Let's ramp up the power even more.
20230124 - 0044:   No ODT trapping
20230124 - 0046:   More cooling -> Nothing still. Perhaps try more IR cooling.
20230124 - 0063:   Next one should be with higher IR power
20230124 - 0065:   !!!!!!! YESSSSSSS
20230124 - 0077:   It also seems that the focus is not precisely where we want it.
20230124 - 0081:   Hmm, perhaps we catch the expanding cloud into our ODT? Interesting
20230124 - 0102:   So superfunky, we can use the laser as a catching net of sorts. We can now use this to center the Laser beam
20230124 - 0103:   Okay, let's try some IR tof as well.
20230124 - 0104:   Yep, we can see the thermal atoms expand from the IR trap - no condensate.
20230124 - 0106:   Try more MT cooling and more ODT cooling
20230124 - 0143:   Let's try to align it better
20230124 - 0144:   Horizontal, tiny bit CCW.
20230124 - 0145:   A bit clockwise
20230124 - 0146:   Clockwise makes it better !!
20230124 - 0147:   Let's lower the MT tof. This is almost perfect
20230124 - 0148:   Almost nothing, strange
20230124 - 0150:   Mmmm
20230124 - 0151:   What funky
20230124 - 0169:   Alright, this looks good, 1 ms IR tof - but the focus seems off, let's try to fix that
20230124 - 0181:   Focus seems shifted, let;s start fixing that - Clockwise from my perspective
20230124 - 0182:   If anything, I'd say this is wrong direction. Go the other one - CCW quite a bit
20230124 - 0183:   Yep, better. Try more tof to be able to determine the particle number and optimize based on that
20230124 - 0187:   Alright, good reference point
20230124 - 0192:   Cool cool cool - Let's check where the center is by checking no MT tof, and no IR
20230124 - 0196:   No tof, center of MT. Quite far off. - shift center massively.
20230124 - 0199:   Maybe too muhc :/
20230124 - 0202:   Empty, it could be that moving the atoms lead to problems, or we shifted the focus too much.
20230124 - 0205:   Hmmm Focus more in the correct direction, but worse
20230124 - 0206:   Try longr IR ramp time
20230124 - 0207:   Well, it looks better already - shift even more? Uffff this is quite a lot then, like damn alot haha. First see if increasing the ramp time has any effect
20230124 - 0208:   Seems okay okay. Couple of more turns, elt's try to get it to the same spot as MT center, which is at 1150, 1100
20230124 - 0209:   Yeah, looks about right actually. Feels like the center. Let's now try to optimize the two mirror screws as well. Let's also try to see if we can get a better result with a more powerful laser as well.
20230124 - 0212:   MM some condensate in here
20230124 - 0217:   Increased the IR frm 3.1 to 4.0
20230124 - 0218:   Seems like significant improvement. Will still have to figure it out - let's go just to max maybe? Or like 8 at least to see if that helps
20230124 - 0219:   Yeah I mean this immediatelly seems much better - IR power at 7
20230124 - 0221:   Seems like no massive improvement since some power ago - we should be able to lower it - try a bit more at this power
20230124 - 0222:   A;right, let's lower the power to 7 and play with the buttons
20230124 - 0223:   Ugh whatt too low?  We can come back to it - top button slightl ccw
20230124 - 0224:   T CCW - starting small
20230124 - 0225:   T CCW
20230124 - 0226:   Empty, shit, went too far? Let's go back CW a bit, Please come backkk
20230124 - 0227:   He's back. Let's go the other way. CW a bit
20230124 - 0230:   CW a bit more
20230124 - 0231:   And a bit more
20230124 - 0233:   Seems too much, wait for one more
20230124 - 0234:   Ugh fine its fine. Go to horizontal. CCW a bit
20230124 - 0235:   CCW a bit more
20230124 - 0236:   Ughhh lost it again? Let's go back
20230124 - 0237:   CW a bit more
20230124 - 0239:   Nooo
20230124 - 0240:   Ugh Ugh go CCw
20230124 - 0241:   Uf epic, we're back Looks good, wrap it up here
20230126 - 0006:   Well this is shit?
20230126 - 0007:   Even for no LN this seems low
20230126 - 0037:   A bit low but okay
20230126 - 0038:   Cool cool. Let's get cooler though.
20230126 - 0045:   Onset of condensation here already?
20230126 - 0049:   No, no condensation here really
20230126 - 0055:   No condensation here
20230126 - 0064:   Funky, so not reaching perfect condensate, no worries - we don't want to in the MT - so the reason was, that the RF2 cooling always lasted only 18 seconds. Let's take again the last 7 seconds of cooling.
20230126 - 0069:   Might need to go with more tof to be more sure - starts hereish
20230126 - 0071:   Condensation here
20230126 - 0073:   Empty
20230126 - 0074:   Empty
20230126 - 0075:   Let's go check
20230126 - 0081:   Lab kaput
20230130 - 0017:   Niceee in the last two the reference image worksss
20230207 - 0052:   Good, alright, we're running
20230207 - 0083:   Woah lekker dingendongen
20230207 - 0087:   Gone
20230208 - 0066:   Stable at 260 M. Might be worth checking all the beam powers again and alignments
20230208 - 0130:   Uf okay let's try something wild, 80 ms tof. Then IR maybe?
20230208 - 0136:   Alright, let's test out the IR trap now. Would eb surprised if we see anything.
20230208 - 0139:   Go IR -> fingers crossed
20230208 - 0140:   Nothing. - maybe too much tof for IR. Check at 15
20230208 - 0144:   No laser effect :/
20230208 - 0145:   Uh this is bad even for no laser. Maybe out of LN?
20230208 - 0156:   Fully empty. Let's check normal 60 seconds no IR
20230208 - 0163:   Oh crap, this seems normal actually. So the problem is in the laser. Bruh :(
20230208 - 0176:   Nope, but it does seem like something is there, the cloud gets smaller
20230221 - 0016:   Alright, getting there I hope.
20230221 - 0024:   Ugh, are we topping off here?
20230221 - 0028:   One of the lights was on, so the images were worse.
20230221 - 0033:   This is not too good :/
20230221 - 0038:   H 1x CW
20230221 - 0039:   
20230221 - 0041:   H 1x CCW
20230221 - 0046:   Top (V) 1x CW

20230221 - 0056:   Bottom (H) 1x CW.
20230221 - 0058:   No change made here. I will wait for a few runs to let it stabilise.
20230221 - 0062:   
20230221 - 0064:   Bottom (H) 1x CW
20230221 - 0068:   Bottom (H) 1x CW
20230221 - 0071:   Bottom (H) 1x CCW
20230221 - 0073:   I think this is a (at least local) maximum so I will switch to varying the vertical alignment.
20230221 - 0076:   Top V) 1x CW
20230221 - 0078:   Top (V) 1x CCW

20230222 - 0008:   Top (vert), CW, 90 to 95 deg
20230222 - 0010:   Top (vert), CW, 95 to 100deg
20230222 - 0038:   Still stabilizng, this is strange, it doesn't typically take this long. But let's leave it for now, we should be near the max
20230222 - 0047:   Bottom (hor), CW, 170 to 175 deg
20230222 - 0051:   Bottom (hor), CCW, 175 to 170 deg
20230222 - 0054:   Top (vert), CCW, 100 to 95 deg
20230222 - 0060:   Top (vert), CCW, 95 to 90 deg
20230222 - 0065:   Top (vert), CW, 90 to 100deg
20230222 - 0069:   Top (vert), CW, 100 to 105deg
20230222 - 0075:   Top (vert), CCW, 105 to 100deg
20230222 - 0078:   Top (vert), CCW, 100 to 95deg
20230222 - 0083:   Top (vert), CW, 95 to 100deg
20230222 - 0088:   Top (vert), CCW, 100 to 95deg
20230222 - 0101:   The particle number does not seem to be very stable.
20230222 - 0102:   Nitrogen flow looks normal so I am not sure what is going on.
20230222 - 0143:   Top (vert), CCW, 100deg
20230223 - 0091:   It's worse. Go the other way, a bit CW
20230223 - 0092:   tiny bit CCW
20230223 - 0093:   Bit more CW
20230223 - 0097:   Oh merciiii <3 Works!
20230223 - 0107:   Looking good good
20230223 - 0119:   Inbetween
20230223 - 0120:   Lovely, pure condensate -> MT of course. But a very very prety one actually. Let's see where we are just before condensation.
20230227 - 0046:   
20230227 - 0047:   Start a list RF cooling 0 - 25 (+1)
20230227 - 0064:   Start list IR depth 0 - 7 (+0.5)
20230228 - 0090:   Begin IR optimization
20230228 - 0091:   T CCW
20230228 - 0092:   Gone?
20230228 - 0093:   Back T CW
20230228 - 0117:   Bit  T CCW -> previously I might have lost the lock of the lasers
20230228 - 0118:   Empty. Ugh, okay maybe wrong direction still
20230228 - 0119:   T CW
20230228 - 0120:   T CW
20230228 - 0121:   B CW
20230228 - 0123:   Empty. B CCW
20230228 - 0124:   Bitchh lost it?
20230228 - 0130:   B CCW
20230228 - 0132:   B CW
20230228 - 0151:   Good but can maybe  do better? CCW tiny bit
20230228 - 0152:   Bit to CW
20230228 - 0153:   Even better
20230228 - 0155:   5 ms tof, should be easier to align. Little lower -> T CW
20230228 - 0156:   Let's get rid of MT cloud and try to optimize the particle number in the ODT
20230228 - 0157:   Maybe also move the focus a little bit? Front-back?
20230228 - 0166:   ODT hold time seems to make no difference so far.
20230228 - 0170:   Seems okay, so let's stop and check a linear ramp of IR power. Cooling
20230228 - 0172:   We might need to increase the IR tof
20230228 - 0174:   This looks quite nice actually. As in big even if just from the ODT
20230228 - 0187:   Doing a linear ramp here (IR trap between 7V -> 4 V, in 10 seconds). We only doing it as long as the ODT is going on.
20230228 - 0203:   Yeah loosing it here. Not sure what to do. No condensation
20230228 - 0208:   Don't think we're focused on theright spot. Back to the lab
20230228 - 0210:   Focus  - CW
20230228 - 0211:   Wrong way - go CCW
20230228 - 0212:   Better. We need to get it to 1127 - 1080. Way more.
20230228 - 0213:   What, uf this is just shitty a bit. Let's take another one.
20230228 - 0214:   Go a bit back
20230228 - 0215:   Better but actually worse than before, no?
20230228 - 0216:   Clockwise
20230228 - 0217:   Bit mroe maybe?
20230228 - 0218:   Why am I getting a higher particle number not where the center of the MT is?
20230228 - 0219:   Maybe the alignment is good, but it is tilted a little, so all the atoms flow to this side of the trap, and then in tof this is how it looks like? Wuold be interesting to see with different odttimes
20230228 - 0220:   Way way bigger - Only MT, to see the center of the trap
20230301 - 0011:   On track, but something seems wrong with nitrogen?
20230301 - 0021:   Ugh so lowwwwwww comeo nn n
20230301 - 0119:   Changed IR depth. Cloud disappears?!
20230301 - 0128:   Torch caused anomaly. Disregard.
20230301 - 0137:   Stabilising about 200mn
20230308 - 0030:   RF2 15 -> 0%
20230308 - 0031:   RF2 15 -> 0%
20230308 - 0032:   RF2 18 -> 1%
20230308 - 0033:   RF2 18 -> 1%
20230308 - 0034:   RF2 19 -> 1%
20230308 - 0035:   RF2 20 -> 2%
20230308 - 0036:   RF2 21 -> 10%
20230308 - 0037:   RF2 22 -> 12%
20230308 - 0038:   RF2 23 -> 25%
20230308 - 0039:   RF2 23 -> 14%
20230308 - 0042:   But we don't need pure condensates anyway, right? Regardless, let's try that, because then maybe we can move the condensates to ODT and check that.
20230308 - 0043:   Seems like loosing it at higer RF. This is the cutout, so need to modify the curves if we want to get pure condensates here
20230308 - 0044:   RF2 23 -> 40%
20230308 - 0045:   RF2 23 -> 40%
20230308 - 0046:   I mean this is almost like a perfect condensate.
20230308 - 0054:   That's almost perfect actually. About 5M in the condensate. Eeh, alright I guess. Struggling to get a realistic condensate fraction. Let's turn on some IR lasers.
20230308 - 0055:   What the hell
20230308 - 0056:   Why is this so much worse than before with the same cooling time?
20230308 - 0057:   Bettter! It seems like it needs some time for the RF to warm up, or what?
20230308 - 0058:   Alright, nice. We can now try to move thermal cloud to ODT and then also the condensate. Might also be worth checking what the IR power is at the moment.
20230308 - 0059:   Cool cool. As expected really, although quite dispersed for 3 ms of tof. Try less tof
20230308 - 0060:   Actually this is not bad, we can use this and vary the RF2 time now.
20230308 - 0061:   Might be too little tof to be fair. Let's stick with 3 ms.
20230308 - 0062:   Running the list now.
20230308 - 0063:   RF2 = 15
20230308 - 0066:   Ugh loosing it hereee. Higher RF2 and hihger condensation fraction doesn't help.
20230308 - 0067:   What the hell happened here? This looks like just MT? Oh maybe 32ms of tof MT is nothing.
20230308 - 0068:   Yeah, it's gotta be that
20230308 - 0069:   And seems like absolutley no component from ODT left. But also tof expansions seem in different places on the frame. I'm not quite happy with that.
20230308 - 0070:   Condensate showing, but that's one in the MT I fear.
20230308 - 0071:   But clearly seen the eliptical trademark of condensates. But also this tells me that all these atoms are not trapped in the ODT. Although maybe the trap is not deep enough to trap these condensed atoms in the first place?
20230308 - 0077:   Looks good even at lower powers. Let's go to even lower.
20230308 - 0079:   Way lower, but still there. Can see both tofs.
20230308 - 0108:   Weaker laser. Shouldn't we be better suited to trap the colder atoms with a lower powered laser? Let's repeat the last list but with a lower laser power. Maybe more than 30 ms of tof?
20230308 - 0131:   Alright, doesn't seem aligned. Let's fix this.
20230308 - 0133:   Let's try left-right
20230308 - 0134:   Okay, let's go aligning.
20230308 - 0135:   B - CCW a bit. Might have overdone it.
20230308 - 0136:   Ugh not sure if I just hit it or lost it. Check at lower cooling
20230308 - 0137:   B CW - did I go CCW or CW before? Ugh might have messed up
20230308 - 0138:   okay it's back. It's lower than it was before. a
20230308 - 0139:   Let;s assume Im an idiot and went CW twice.Let's go CCW now.
20230308 - 0141:   Go to lower cooling
20230308 - 0142:   Hmm, lost it completley?
20230308 - 0144:   Too high - gotta go more CW - went so little I'm not even sure if I even did anything
20230308 - 0145:   Better. Crazy how small changes.
20230308 - 0146:   Nice, seems better - but it feels like the focus is not perfect
20230308 - 0150:   little bit of it is there.
20230308 - 0153:   empty. I think it might be that I'm not aligned along the other axis
20230308 - 0161:   Take one at 0 tof, and go to the other axis.
20230308 - 0163:   Less coolinh
20230308 - 0164:   A little bit, enough to try and optimize. Let's go to T CW
20230308 - 0165:   Shit, this seemed to help a lot
20230308 - 0168:   smaller and smalle, still hitting it. Let's move it impossibly little in CCW
20230308 - 0170:   Too high, somehow have to go lower. Uff so delicate goodness
20230308 - 0172:   Better, one more this much
20230308 - 0175:   Cool cool still there. Let's go vertical. T CW
20230308 - 0176:   Seems better, right? 100%
20230308 - 0177:   Lovelyy. This has got to be a condensate in there somewhere.
20230308 - 0179:   Not quite perfectt
20230314 - 0010:   What the helllllllllllllllllll it's even worse
20230314 - 0016:   put it to 4.5 mW
20230314 - 0022:   This helped absolutely nothing, if anything it's way worse.
20230314 - 0095:   Bottom CW 4oclock to 5oclock
20230314 - 0100:   Feels like a wrong fit, don't worry about it
20230314 - 0104:   Top ACW 4oclock to 3oclock
20230314 - 0112:   Nice, it feels like its improving  - just luck, JP! - jinxed it
20230314 - 0113:   
20230314 - 0114:   Bottom CW 5oclock to 6oclock
20230314 - 0117:   Bottom ACW 6oclock to 5oclock

20230314 - 0132:   Top CW 3oclock to 4oclock
20230314 - 0143:   Top CW 4oclock to 5oclock
20230315 - 0022:   MT coils messing up. Let's hope a simple reset fixes it
20230315 - 0023:   Resetting it seemed to work. Now camera issues.
20230315 - 0049:   Something happened
20230315 - 0133:   Fucking hellll. Let's optimize the zeeman beam I guess. Starting with vertical
20230315 - 0134:   Vertical CCW
20230315 - 0135:   V CCW
20230315 - 0140:   V CW
20230315 - 0190:   alright alright alright the repump power was too high?
20230316 - 0027:   Rise up
20230316 - 0031:   Oh man I have a feeling this is all of a sudden gonna turn the other way around. Let's hope we can get TC reliably enough
20230316 - 0053:   Ugh looks okay, and fairly stable as well.
20230316 - 0069:   Looped over loading time - 10 to 20 seconds, no difference. So that's not it. Let's try to check if hold time has any effect on it. Looping from 40ms to 10040 ms, increments by 1000ms.
20230316 - 0070:   Lol, that is 0.04 ms
20230316 - 0073:   Ugh, that's odd.
20230316 - 0078:   Seems more or less stable as well.
20230316 - 0080:   Also seems to not affect the particle number too much
20230316 - 0082:   Something seems off here.
20230316 - 0084:   Ughh bad shit.
20230316 - 0085:   Wayy lower, as wel expected -> after 17 s cooling
20230316 - 0088:   Let's see if we can get a condensate in a decompressed trap - and a time crystal.
20230316 - 0091:   Alright alright, small, very sad. Not sure how this would look like in OAH.
20230316 - 0092:   Ughhh. I think the particle number is the problem.
20230316 - 0131:   ramped up the repump powers to max (not sure actual values)
20230316 - 0132:   Yeah, better it seems?
20230316 - 0134:   Maybe do some alignment?
20230316 - 0135:   T CW
20230316 - 0143:   V CCW 2x
20230316 - 0149:   V CW, H CW
20230316 - 0153:   Whattt the fuckkkkkkkk
20230316 - 0155:   This is unbelievable, nothing helps
20230316 - 0156:   H CCW
20230316 - 0162:   MOT repump B a bit towards me
20230316 - 0170:   Please please please please
20230317 - 0033:   
20230317 - 0034:   
20230317 - 0035:   Top, CW, 6oclock to 7oclock (approx)
20230317 - 0038:   Like how much and which knobs you turn
20230317 - 0039:   Can you guys also put some comments here, just so I roughly know what's going on
20230317 - 0040:   Top, CW, 7 to 8oclock
20230317 - 0043:   Top, CW, 8oclock to 9oclock (too far!)

20230317 - 0054:   Top, ACW, 5 to 4 oclock
20230317 - 0059:   Top, ACW, 3 to 2 oclock
20230317 - 0062:   we only see fluctuations, no improvements

20230317 - 0164:   Btoom, 4 to 6 oclock
20230317 - 0211:   Ugh bleh super meh. Let's recirculate over the weekend, and hope that helps. We haven't in a while, so it might be useufl.
20230320 - 0039:   Laser powers were on the low side - increased them. Hope for better results.
20230320 - 0045:   Bottom ACW 5 oclock

20230320 - 0093:   T ACW 2 oclock
20230320 - 0096:   From 3,2 oclock T starts to get worst
20230320 - 0099:   T 5 oclock
20230321 - 0039:   Yep, number dropping here. So too much spinpol is not good. 750 us seems good enough
20230321 - 0051:   SPINPOL OFF -> much lower particle number, but not quite the factor of two, so we might gain some by aligning it better? Hmm.
20230321 - 0056:   As always, please keep track of your changes in the comments
20230321 - 0060:   Lower mirror, bottom dial, 4oclock to 6oclock CW

20230321 - 0113:   Repump, bottom, 7oclock to 8oclock, CW
20230321 - 0115:   Bit of a dip

20230321 - 0163:   Repump T 6, B 6, Z 5
20230322 - 0028:   This is crap man
20230322 - 0035:   No spinpol vs spinpol seems like a small difference. Hmm. Perhaps check the alignment of the spinpol?
20230322 - 0036:   I mean, yeah, obvious difference, but nowhere near a factor of 2.
20230322 - 0044:   Spinpol B 1H CW
20230322 - 0045:

20230419 - 0071:   Boom - condensate in the ODT!! But we get it in the magnetic trap already, so not ideal.
20230419 - 0080:   Very nice.
20230419 - 0085:   Changed the curves
20230419 - 0092:   Oh cool cools
20230419 - 0101:   Funky, what the hell is this?
20230419 - 0108:   Ohhhh dude I was kicking those hahaha oopsie
20230419 - 0113:   Gone?
20230420 - 0113:   DIPOLE TRAP ON -- Trap the condensates.
20230420 - 0117:   All at IR TOF = 5 ms so far. Let's loop these over.
20230420 - 0137:   Increased tof for magnetic trap to get rid of more MT atoms
20230420 - 0141:   Let's go in small increments of ODT TOF - to check how it looks and calculate the velocities. yeah so that's a dead end
20230420 - 0142:   What the hell, how and what is this?
20230420 - 0143:   What how is this so differnt? What is going on?
20230420 - 0144:   Ugh
20230420 - 0145:   one explanation is that we're not overlapping the MT with ODT perfectly and we induce some motion of the condensate between the two centers?
20230420 - 0146:   Try larger ODT times? Then maybe it has more time to stabilize. Because there does seem to be some motion to the 'right'
20230420 - 0147:   Bring ODT time to 4 seconds
20230420 - 0148:   Interesting - probably it warms up too much for the condensation to remain?
20230420 - 0184:   LN ran out
20230421 - 0001:   TOF way too large
20230421 - 0030:   Lovelyyy but still this weird trippler
20230421 - 0034:   ODT before condensation here. Let's try to cool in the ODT.
20230421 - 0036:   Should be just thermal cloud I think at 30 ms tof
20230421 - 0040:   Slowly showing
20230421 - 0044:   Should be only odt here.
20230421 - 0052:   Okay, let's begin with cooling.
20230421 - 0076:   start iteration ( 1 to 2 finaql cooling depth, 0,25 steps)
20230421 - 0134:   Whatt so small
20230425 - 0026:   Okay, something there at 3 s RF1 and no tof. Let's check at 30s
20230425 - 0027:   Yeah, still there, much smaller.
20230425 - 0029:   Real number
20230425 - 0048:   Ugh so lowwww what on earth, why - nitrogen is running
20230425 - 0120:   Try OAH but on resonance. I wonder.
20230425 - 0121:   Funky. Seems like an unwrapping issue? In the middle?
20230425 - 0122:   Not as much in phase
20230425 - 0123:   10 ms tof -> nice, you can tell it's not as much phase object.
20230425 - 0124:   I guess tof of 2 messes it up, like we expect.
20230425 - 0128:   BOTH BEAMS - double interference
20230425 - 0129:   Double interference
20230425 - 0130:   Double, but both are shit.
20230425 - 0131:   Alright, let's detune.
20230425 - 0132:   Both shit, still
20230425 - 0133:   DETUNED This one is back with ''proper detuning''. Shite. Let's keep taking, perhaps we're not fully condensed? Wishful thinking. Then go to single beams.
20230425 - 0134:   !! Netjess. Nice, possibly the best one yet with double interference.
20230425 - 0135:   Again, fairly decent, definetely both have a condensate in it. Faint and small, but there.
20230425 - 0136:   Empty.
20230425 - 0137:   !!! This one best one so far with detuned beams. Still super small though
20230425 - 0138:   Eh eh
20230425 - 0139:   eh eh also. 137 ftw so far.
20230425 - 0140:   !! Pretty good as well, similar to 137
20230425 - 0141:   !!! Also fairly decent, comparable to137.
20230425 - 0142:   Just for lolz tried to cool a second more. Maybe a better condensate there? Yeah, pretty good.
20230425 - 0143:   !! okay
20230425 - 0144:   Small but there.
20230425 - 0145:   Eh. Okay, let's try separate beams now.
20230425 - 0147:   Only REF 1 - a bit sad, let's lower the cooling back to 24
20230425 - 0148:   Nice, a bit small, but there.
20230425 - 0149:   Small but there.
20230425 - 0150:   Small but there - are we cooling too little perhaps, the edges seem kinda non-condensed. Go back to 25?
20230425 - 0153:   U lekker. I guess best for single beam 1
20230425 - 0156:   BEAM2 - Ugh. Either it's disapearing or we have a problem with the second beam
20230425 - 0157:   Eh still a bit said unfortunatelly. Maybe we're just loosing it.
20230425 - 0160:   All a bit sad
20230426 - 0006:   Cap on
20230426 - 0007:   Nice!
20230426 - 0012:   Ugh just started to drop. Bruh
20230426 - 0056:   Maybe out of LN? Could it be?
20230426 - 0059:   Whatttt where is this coming from? Gotta be LN, let's go check
20230426 - 0065:   What's going on, goodness. LN is fine.
20230426 - 0066:   I increased the loading time from 10s to 20s and it seemed weirdly to help. Of course saying this, will make the next particle number drop to probably 0. Or acknowledging this will cancel it. Idk, this works weirdly. Maybe this is a social experiment where I'm being tested in face of adversity. Or things are random and we're seing how long it takes for me to notice
20230501 - 0025:   Optimized the laser itself by twisting the IR mirrors and the SHG mirrors for the incoupling into the cavity. We were able to raise the power from 120mW to about 140 mW.
20230501 - 0027:   No fucking difference go to hell.
20230501 - 0041:   Somehow the particle number seems okay? I don't wanna jinx it
20230501 - 0109:   Funky. This is at 15 ms MT tof
20230501 - 0113:   tof pointless, MT channels on. Let's align it here though.
20230501 - 0114:   B CW - Other way I guess.
20230501 - 0115:   Ups, too far it seems. Back down. B CW
20230501 - 0116:   Uf uf, CW a bit more.
20230501 - 0117:   It's back. A bit too far again. Let's bring it a bit higer ie b CCW more?
20230501 - 0119:   I mean this seems to go through the center, no?
20230501 - 0120:   Seems a bit to the side, no? Try with some MT tof
20230501 - 0121:   Getting rid of the MT more or less.
20230501 - 0123:   Shift focus perhaps? Might be worth investigating based on IR trap tof?
20230501 - 0126:   Eh so sadddd. This is with 6 ms tof
20230501 - 0130:   back at 0, 0. Let's try to push back and forth. Focus 3 CW from my perspective
20230501 - 0131:   I mean hard to say. Perhaps we can try with more tof in MT?
20230501 - 0133:   Center;s not aligned, Seems like the wrong way CCW a bunch
20230501 - 0134:   Better, but smaller?
20230501 - 0135:   Try to move it more in focus, then play with up down? 5 CCW
20230501 - 0136:   Lost it? Still there a bit, but perhaps focus better but misaligned along up-down? Tiny bit clockwise, probably too much.
20230501 - 0137:   Somehow better, but now it's too low again?
20230501 - 0138:   Ugh not sure to be hoenst. For sure better aligned, but not sure how to make it better. Focus perhaps too far now?
20230501 - 0139:   I'd say let's try more with the T button, for upwards-downwards. Bit more cw
20230501 - 0140:   I guess better, try a bit more.
20230501 - 0141:   Woah wait up. Almost nothing but the trap :o Is this what we're after?
20230501 - 0142:   Perhaps pull focus a bit to the back? Some cheeky CW focus rotationsd
20230501 - 0145:   Alright, some atoms in the thermal cloud of the ODT it seems. Perhaps we can use this to maximize the pnum by twisting the knobs
20230501 - 0147:   Focus CCW
20230501 - 0149:   Focus CCW
20230501 - 0153:   I think it should go the other way maybe not
20230501 - 0156:   A bit back. My plan is to put it to where the MT center was.
20230501 - 0157:   I mean yeah roughly here, but the particle number is the lowest
20230501 - 0158:   Yeah this feels not promising. Try up down alignment. CW a bit\
20230501 - 0159:   Not much change imo. Top CW more.
20230501 - 0160:   Maybe a bit better, but very small changes. Try more CW
20230501 - 0163:   Too much maybe?
20230501 - 0164:   Too much, CCW
20230501 - 0165:   The fuck? Maybe we're losing it somewhere else, like Zeeman power and all, the typical losses?
20230501 - 0169:   Empty but this is just mt shouldbe
20230501 - 0171:   Ugh yeah its there but where have we lost it with IR?
20230501 - 0174:   There's literally no MT atoms, this is at 0 tof also in MT
20230502 - 0026:   All empty here. What the hell is going on here.
20230502 - 0027:   What, this should def not be empty?
20230502 - 0028:   Bulshit, something is off here. But the lasers were locked the last I checked.
20230502 - 0037:   Uff now we're talkinggg, let's fucking go. Excuse my language.
20230502 - 0039:   Farily lovely. Let's cool. Actually, lets try something else -> let's condense in MT and then transfer, to see if that works. These are all with 200ms tof in MT btw.
20230502 - 0041:   This should be condensed in MT -> ODT -> ODT tof
20230502 - 0043:   Not condensed, seems like we might be struggling with the transfer of the condensate. So let's indeed cool in the ODT.
20230502 - 0044:   Okay - so, now let's schedule a list of runs, where we cool down over [0.5, 1, 2] seconds from 6V (whatever that value is) to 0 in decrements of 0.5 V.
20230502 - 0045:   Hm, not what I expected - this should be at no cooling (so 6V - 6V) in 0.5 sec. Oh actually no no, it goes to zero, I forgot to change it.
20230502 - 0046:   Alright, try again. Fingers crossed
20230502 - 0047:   Very nice actually, damn I'm excited
20230502 - 0048:   
20230502 - 0049:   Should be interestig to also investigate just the IR depths (we now set it to 6, but would be useful to go smaller).
20230502 - 0050:   Seems like not a lot of difference in cooling times - this is still at practically no change in cooling.
20230502 - 0051:   
20230502 - 0052:   About 10M in the thermal cloud, no condensation yet.
20230502 - 0053:   
20230502 - 0054:   Hmm don't like this.Maybe just an outlier
20230502 - 0055:   Back to the usual I guess.
20230502 - 0056:   
20230502 - 0057:   Nothing yet ...
20230502 - 0058:   
20230502 - 0059:   Will be plotting with some divergent plots to see the edge better I guess.
20230502 - 0060:   
20230502 - 0061:   
20230502 - 0062:   
20230502 - 0063:   
20230502 - 0064:   
20230502 - 0065:   
20230502 - 0066:   
20230502 - 0067:   
20230502 - 0068:   
20230502 - 0069:   
20230502 - 0070:   
20230502 - 0071:   
20230502 - 0072:   
20230502 - 0073:

20230502 - 0078:   
20230502 - 0079:   
20230502 - 0080:   
20230502 - 0081:   
20230502 - 0082:   
20230502 - 0085:   Roughly where we left it - lowering the initial cooling value from 6 down until we see where we still capture the cloud. Then cooling from there down to 1V, where we got condensates the last time.
20230502 - 0089:   Still here - but seems smaller, perhaps we're cooling off too much now
20230502 - 0090:   Condensate here. At around 1V.
20230502 - 0091:   Empty, of course. Let's now go slowly from 3 cooling to 0.2 or something, in steps of 0.2
20230502 - 0117:   Roughly here it seems to be condensing
20230502 - 0122:   Check how the ramp speed influences the condensation. Also - Possilby slowly running out of LN, and I'd imagine the temps are getting higher and higher
20230502 - 0124:   Doesn't seem to affect it much it seems.
20230502 - 0125:   Losing it. Getting worse. Too slow ramp?
20230502 - 0126:   Alright - let's now vary the speed with which we turn on the ODT - from 0.1 to 2s or so.
20230502 - 0133:   Try the difference between the cubic spline and linear raise. These ones are with linear raise ...
20230502 - 0136:   ... and these with the cubic spline. For now it seems to work better. Might be an idea to also try this with the cooling :o
20230502 - 0138:   
20230502 - 0148:   Seems like we're loosing it
20230502 - 0151:   
20230502 - 0152:   Yeah particle number super low. This explains it
20230503 - 0023:   Fuck sake, a bit shitty
20230503 - 0036:   Iterating over odttime 0.5 to 2ms, 0.25 steps
20230503 - 0037:   Slight increase in ODT time to 0.75, BEC disappears???
20230503 - 0039:   Back down to 0.5, BEC reappears
20230503 - 0043:   TOF increased to see the condensate better
20230503 - 0045:   No bec again??
20230503 - 0046:   Darker but obvious BEC
20230503 - 0048:   Back to BEC
20230503 - 0050:   iterating over cooling depth from 0.5 ro 1.5v at 0.5
20230503 - 0059:   
20230503 - 0060:   iterating odttime 0.5 to 2 ms , depth 3 to 1 v, tof 3, steps 0.2
20230503 - 0061:   0.7
20230503 - 0083:   This is cool - the weird stripey thing
20230503 - 0112:   Ugh but like looking at the cooling particle numbers, it seems like there is already some decrease in the first 3 seconds or so, so there is some cooling
20230503 - 0113:   
20230503 - 0130:   This is gotta be condensed, right? - 450 ms cooling
20230503 - 0135:   Let's try something else - exponential drop to 0.6, but with varying speeds -> to determine the ideal cooling rate, hopefully.
20230503 - 0136:   Seems too fast, I hope
20230503 - 0140:   Seems to be the sweet spot
20230503 - 0143:   Loosing it again - too long now? or other effects?
20230503 - 0150:   Ou netjes
20230503 - 0151:   Ook netjes
20230503 - 0152:   I wanna try now something else - if anything changes if I keep the laser on longer before starting to cool - either, we'll trap more, or we'll start losing the particles due to collisions
20230503 - 0159:   Overall decreasing it seems
20230503 - 0160:   If channel disabled it resets back to old values. Alright. Let's now also investigate the raise time again
20230503 - 0161:   Even when instantenous we still get it haha, lol
20230503 - 0167:   No big differences here I'd say
20230503 - 0172:   The shape of the cooling curve doesn't seem to affect it too much just yet.
20230503 - 0175:   I mean for sure condensed - check the fits
20230504 - 0001:   All still empty
20230504 - 0028:   What where are all the atoms? Are we down to 120M ?
20230504 - 0062:   Top 4 to 3 (oclock)
20230504 - 0070:   top 3 to 2
20230504 - 0074:   T 2 to 2.5
20230504 - 0077:   Top 2.5 to 4.5
20230504 - 0085:   top 4.5 to 4
20230504 - 0226:   Ugh I think the laser powers might have dropped too much to get anything useful :/
20230504 - 0231:   Nah this seems gone. Call it here
20230508 - 0052:   Oh my godd I didn't change the RF channel so this is just random? Ugh
20230508 - 0088:   Run list with different RF2 times. Actually, will this give us any new information? We want to move the particle after we have done *almost* all necessary cooling, right? And then finalize in the ODT.
20230508 - 0089:   ou this is nice? There's cooling in all these shots.
20230508 - 0090:   Saturated for sure
20230508 - 0091:   Let's do more tof to see if it's actually condensed
20230508 - 0095:   Stripey and I'll say, condensy. Try same thing with different cooling speeds
20230508 - 0097:   ! Starting a run to determine the stripy pattern as a funciton of cooling time.
20230508 - 0098:   ! This is a neat one.
20230508 - 0099:   ! Even neater! Still stripy though
20230508 - 0100:   !!! Mammaa, very lekker, and the stripes are gone when we cool for longer? Interesting.
20230508 - 0101:   !!! Woah - BIG BOY CONDENSATE IN ODT
20230508 - 0102:   Ugh funky, and mostly far moved as well :o Stripes kinda back?
20230508 - 0104:   Oh very nice indeed.
20230508 - 0106:   Almost no thermal cloud.
20230508 - 0109:   Feels like stripes want to appear.
20230508 - 0125:   changed LN
20230508 - 0129:   Lets a go flipping
20230508 - 0130:   Woah woah woah a chessboard pattern? This is at 15 ms tof from IR trap. Let's go to 25
20230508 - 0132:   Ugh not sure there's much going on here. Let's try the same thing without spinfliping to see how it looks.
20230508 - 0134:   It looks strangley the same - spinflipping not super effective.
20230508 - 0135:   Try it wihtout the spinflipping -> same thing
20230508 - 0136:   Try the same but wihtout the stern-gerlach
20230508 - 0137:   No stern-gerlach, exactly the same, it seems. Same chessboard thingy/
20230508 - 0138:   high = 300 mV
20230508 - 0139:   it moveedd i thinkk. Try now a single sweep, from 3.5 to 2 MHz, no hold, no nothing. For 60 ms
20230508 - 0140:   Nothing. Try increasing to 500 mV
20230508 - 0141:   Also nothing. This is at 500 mV, try lower. Like 200
20230508 - 0142:   Shit also nothing at 200 mV. Nothing here. Go to 330
20230508 - 0143:   Check if the antenna is working even. Lol, I might have forgotten a power supply for the antenna. Lel. try again
20230508 - 0144:   Ugh bro. Let's go to where we saw it with Amber - 60ms 3.5 - 2 MHz scan, Vamp = 300 ms
20230508 - 0145:   Just got faint as hell. Try no antenna, to see if its that that's causing the faintness.
20230508 - 0147:   Yeah much brighter. But maybe loosing it a bit
20230508 - 0149:   Nothing.
20230508 - 0150:   Ugh, maybe laser powers too low for anything? So odd though.
20230508 - 0152:   Yeah, surely smaller than before. But that shouldn't affect it, right, the effects should be visible still.
20230508 - 0157:   Stripey but suspect the magnetic field
20230508 - 0158:   I mean it still doesn't seem like MOT is moving anything anywhere
20230508 - 0159:   Ohhh shifted baby
20230508 - 0161:   Okay, shift clearly works, spinflipping maybe not so much
20230508 - 0164:   Is that a little dip to the right? Or am I imagining things
20230508 - 0166:   This weird thing surely seemed to move, no?
20230508 - 0168:   Alright, so stern-gerlach should work, but the spinflipping still doesn't.
20230508 - 0169:   No delay produces this. I don't quite understand what the delay is for. But it almost seems like there are some 0 state particles as well? Let's try delay+MT
20230509 - 0001:   Eh not sure I trust this number
20230509 - 0005:   Check at RF2
20230509 - 0007:   Go to ODT. Very nice. Go straight to spinflipping
20230509 - 0009:   4 MHz - 2.5 MHz, 20ms, 300mV - 10mV

Shifted for sure. Possibly need more tof for the stern-gerlach to do its thing. But also, it seems like we are shifting the entire cloud, no spinflipping. Try to increase the voltage for the next one.
20230509 - 0010:   4 MHz - 2.5 MHz, 20ms, 300mV - 10mV
20230509 - 0011:   4 MHz - 2.5 MHz, 20ms, 5V (highest possible) - 10mV
A small note, on what  I do - > I set the frequency sweep on the AWG to 30 ms duration, but the channel length only to 20 ms, so that I interupt it 2/3 way through. So the actual final frequency is lower than the limit
20230509 - 0012:   Try now a very small frequency amplitude - 20mV. Also, we should repeat the runs multiple times, just to make sur we are acutally triggering the frequency sweep. Might also consider going to the other AWG, just to make sure
20230509 - 0013:   2 MHz - 4 MHz, 0mV - 20 mV, 30ms/20ms. Seems like nothing is happening.
20230509 - 0014:   Should be exactly the same as the last one. But different image.
20230509 - 0015:   2 MHz - 4 MHz, 0mV - 300 mV, 30ms/30ms. Seems like nothing is happening.
20230509 - 0016:   2 MHz - 4 MHz, 0mV - 300 mV, 30ms/30ms. Seems like nothing is happening.
20230509 - 0017:   3.5 MHz - 2 MHz, 0mV - 300 mV, 30ms/30ms. Seems like nothing is happening.
20230509 - 0018:   Same stoy. But also, there's this wild **horizontal** stripy behaviour going on. Let's try at higher finetune magnetic field.
20230509 - 0019:   Trying another funky thing - keep the fintune on the entire time.
20230509 - 0020:   Woah drasticaly different, but I think that's just the finetune talking? Or maybe we literally spinflipped it all into the +1 state?  3.5 MHz - 2 MHz, 0mV - 300 mV, 30ms/30ms. Perhaps try the frequency scan in the other direction, to confirm the theory. Also, try putting the cooling stage before the spinflipping. Then you should expect no domains, but rather what we saw with Amber. Woah this could be physics bro (also figure 4.1 in Bons)
20230509 - 0021:   Woah, yeah diffrent, but this does feel like fintune. let's turn it off during the tof and sg (or well, before that to beprecise). Here still spinflipping before cooling)
20230509 - 0022:   yeah, that's more like what we expected. No finetune during the tof, back what we had before.
20230509 - 0023:   Right. Now let's cool first, then spinflip. So all we did was turn around the cooling and spinflipping stage.
20230509 - 0024:   No difference with the order 3.5 MHz - 2 MHz, 0mV - 300 mV, 30ms/30ms. Seems like nothing is happening.
20230509 - 0025:   Try longer sweep
20230509 - 0026:   Nothing special really. 3.5 MHz - 2 MHz, 10mV - 300 mV, 60ms/30ms. Could it be that we're not really condensed? But then still we should see different spin species, no?
20230509 - 0027:   3.5 MHz - 2 MHz, 0mV - 300 mV, 60ms/60ms. Ugh, I mean nice shift of the -1, but doesn't seem like spinflipping does its thing.
20230509 - 0030:   Tried turning the sweep off, if that's the problem, that the trigger then turns it on, but don't think so. And no difference really. Let's try longer spinflipping time. Longer ramp that is  (500ms). After, let's also try something short like 3ms.a
20230509 - 0031:   Try it again, just because it looks so funky
20230509 - 0032:   try the 5 ms now. Also then perhaps we can try cooling deeper, maybe we're not quite condensed yet.
20230509 - 0033:   Nope.
20230509 - 0064:   Ugh I don't know thennn - might go to OAH to check there before loosing too much time with spinflipping, but it's pretty important, no? I could try the other RF cabinet.
20230509 - 0068:   ... till here
20230509 - 0086:   did some test shots, all empty.
20230509 - 0087:   Funky. 3.5 MHz - 2 MHz, 10mV - 300 mV,  20ms/20ms. Nothing
20230509 - 0093:   definetely some splitting
20230509 - 0094:   800mW in high/low settings. Let's try Vrms.
20230509 - 0096:   3 clouds visible, but small.
20230509 - 0097:   Best so far. Cooling before spin flipping
20230509 - 0099:   ok.
20230509 - 0113:   
20230509 - 0114:   4.0-2.0 MHz, 60ms, 100mVrms (strong mF=-1, no mF=0,1)
20230509 - 0119:   4.0-2.0 MHz, 60ms, 150mVrms (strong mF=-1, faint mF=0, no MF=1)
20230509 - 0121:   4.0-2.0 MHz, 60ms, 200mVrms (strong mF=-1, faint mF=0, no mF=1)
20230509 - 0124:   4.0-2.0 MHz, 60ms, 250mVrms (strong mF=-1, visible mF=0, no mF=1)
20230509 - 0129:   4.0-2.0 MHz, 60ms, 300mVrms (weak mF=-1, weak mF=0, no mF=1)
20230509 - 0130:   Only mF=-1 visible
20230509 - 0140:   no IR tof - let's try some splitting in situ, how it looks.
20230509 - 0141:   stern-gerlach but with no IR tof.
20230509 - 0144:   Haha yeah feels stretched. Which I guess is just one of the components being pulled? Try more tof
20230509 - 0145:   Woahhhh this is quite a pull, ha
20230509 - 0147:   No real difference really as with the normal stern-gerlach.
20230509 - 0149:   Little condensate still there. Hm, let's try longer stern-gerlach (25ms) and only 5ms of those tof. So not combining it in the same channel.
20230509 - 0150:   Interesting, it does what I want it to do, but that's about it haha. Let's try more SG time and less TOF
20230509 - 0159:   Interesting - 5 ms tof and SG of 45 or something
20230509 - 0160:   But seems very low on the particle number, loosing it persistently.
20230511 - 0016:   Interesting - opening the LN more seems to give us more particles? Should we see how far we can push this? I don't want to overflow it, but it seems like the particle number is dependent on that, so..
20230511 - 0032:   Whaat, is this condensed already? Oh possibly, I didn't change the values of the odttime yet -> Now I have, so next ones should be along the list with variable cooling time - so we should see the transition, hopefully.
20230511 - 0033:   (no cooling, straight from the trap)
20230511 - 0035:   Condensation begins
20230511 - 0036:   Very nicely condesed, much more than before, nice bimodal distribution. Still seems stripy.
20230511 - 0037:   Again this motion, seems to shift the condensate quite far. Actually, seems to shift it outside the thermal cloud, like we're stripping it out of the thermal atoms
20230511 - 0042:   Empty, strange. Better be lasers, otherwise not sure what could it be
20230511 - 0045:   4.0-2.0 MHz, 60ms, 300mVrms - No shift?
20230511 - 0048:   Doesn't seem to shift, for some reason. Unless we flipped all of them to mf =0 - try less powerful spinflip
20230511 - 0050:   Super super stripy here, but no spinflip still. But crazy stripey. Seems like SG doesn't work - becuase if it did, then we expect some shift either way, we are in the -1 state, right, at least partially.
20230511 - 0051:   Try keeping the MOT switch on the entire time (lower it to zero at PB off) and then rampt it during the SG
20230511 - 0052:   Maybe not enought IR tof?
20230511 - 0053:   Very nice! James takes over. Keep comments!
20230511 - 0063:   COOLING THEN FLIPPING - 4.0-2.0 MHz, 60ms, 100mVrms - Strong narrow mF-1, Weak broad mF0, no mF1
20230511 - 0065:   4.0-2.0 MHz, 60ms, 150mVrms - Strong narrow mF-1, Weak broad mF0, no mF1. All shifted right compared to before.
20230511 - 0066:   Much longer mF-1 and stronger mF0
20230511 - 0068:   4.0-2.0 MHz, 60ms, 200 mVrms - Weak broad mF-1, Weak broad mF0, no mF1.
20230511 - 0069:   mF-1 much stronger again. Nice
20230511 - 0070:   Smaller than before but equally sized mF-1 and mF0
20230511 - 0071:   Banana mF-1, circle mF0. Fruit theory abounds
20230511 - 0072:   mf-1 looks like a half circle, mF0 is a full circle. Is there something deeper?
20230511 - 0073:   4.0-2.0 MHz, 60ms, 250 mVrms - Weak broad mF-1, Weak broad mF0, maybe mF1?
20230511 - 0076:   mF-1 is almost a line!
20230511 - 0077:   Weak again. Where did the extra particle numbers go?
20230511 - 0078:   4.0-2.0 MHz, 60ms, 300 mVrms - Weak naroow mF-1, Weak broad mF0
20230511 - 0081:   Bit better now but not great. Few more runs to stabilise
20230511 - 0082:   WHAT WHY?
20230511 - 0086:   4.0-2.0 MHz, 60ms, 350 mVrms - mF-1 barely visible. No other components
20230511 - 0089:   Small mF-1 but pretty horrid overall
20230511 - 0090:   4.0-2.0 MHz, 60ms, 400 mVrms - mF-1 barely visible. No other components
20230511 - 0094:   Pretty useless to go any higher. Nothing in the trap
20230511 - 0095:   FLIPPING THEN COOLING FROM NOW ON - 4.0-2.0 MHz, 60ms, 100 mVrms - mF-1 very strong. No other components
20230511 - 0096:   only mf-1 present
20230511 - 0099:   4.0-2.0 MHz, 60ms, 150 mVrms - same as 100 mVrms
20230511 - 0100:   4.0-2.0 MHz, 60ms, 200 mVrms -Narrow mf-1 and barely visible mf0
20230511 - 0102:   4.0-2.0 MHz, 60ms, 250 mVrms - mf0 not mf-1
20230511 - 0103:   mf-1 and mf0 more visible
20230511 - 0104:   interesting, looks better
20230511 - 0108:   4.0-2.0 MHz, 60ms, 300 mVrms - blank
20230511 - 0123:   why tho, mogu bi bit
20230511 - 0139:   4.0-2.0 MHz, 60ms, 250 mVrms - changed from 300mVrms
20230511 - 0142:   4.0-2.0 MHz, 60ms, 200 mVrms - changed from 250mVrms
20230511 - 0145:   4.0-2.0 MHz, 60ms, 210 mVrms - changed from 200mVrms - nice balance
20230511 - 0147:   4.0-2.0 MHz, 60ms, 220 mVrms - changed from 210mVrms - too much mf0
20230511 - 0149:   4.0-2.0 MHz, 60ms, 190 mVrms - changed from 220mVrms - too weak mf0
20230511 - 0150:   4.0-2.0 MHz, 60ms, 210 mVrms - changed from 190mVrms - bit of i'ference from my phone
20230511 - 0151:   210mVrms has the best balance. Low particle number but external factors maybe?
20230511 - 0153:   I was adjusting the sig gen so ignore this.
20230511 - 0154:   2.0-4.0 MHz, 60ms, 210 mVrms - no mF0???? Not sure what happened
20230511 - 0157:   4.0-2.0 MHz, 60ms, 210 mVrms - only scanning from high to low works!?
20230511 - 0158:   4.0-2.0 MHz, 10ms, 210 mVrms - no flip as expected
20230511 - 0160:   4.0-2.0 MHz, 30 ms, 210 mVrms - no barely flip
20230511 - 0161:   4.0-2.0 MHz, 90 ms, 210 mVrms - mF0 only overflipped like a bad pancake
20230511 - 0163:   4.0-2.0 MHz, 75 ms, 210 mVrms - more in mF0 but not much
20230511 - 0166:   4.0-2.0 MHz, 70 ms, 210 mVrms - slight mf-1
20230511 - 0168:   4.0-2.0 MHz, 50 ms, 210 mVrms - good mf-1 low mf0
20230511 - 0170:   4.0-2.0 MHz, 40 ms, 210 mVrms - very strong mf-1 low mf0
20230511 - 0171:   4.0-2.0 MHz, 55 ms, 210 mVrms - very strong mf-1 low mf0
20230511 - 0172:   4.0-2.0 MHz, 65 ms, 210 mVrms - pretty even\
20230511 - 0177:   mF - 1 prone to disappearing
20230511 - 0178:   Coffee time
20230511 - 0183:   4.0-2.0 MHz, 35 ms, 210 mVrms - mf-1 mf0 small\
20230511 - 0186:   4.0-2.0 MHz, 45 ms, 210 mVrms - not great not terrible
20230515 - 0026:   Lovely, where I left it! Go to OAH today.
20230515 - 0048:   Spinflip, all in -1
20230515 - 0053:   Pretty well swept. This is 4-2-4, 60ms each way, no hold time.
20230515 - 0066:   1st OAH of the dipole trap
20230515 - 0068:   A bit sad :/
20230515 - 0070:   1 ms of tof, not good. In OAH, looks sad. We could try less detuning perhaps?
20230515 - 0071:   Could go potentially to -110 MHz detuning by using the non-modulated beam of the probe
20230515 - 0072:   back to 0 tof
20230515 - 0076:   Still a bit sad, it's only a few pixels wide. And by few I mean 2/3
20230515 - 0078:   with spinflipping & SG - shifted, but no splitting really.
20230515 - 0079:   Something seems wrong
20230515 - 0080:   Something here already, but faint. Might have to do with the unlocked lasers. Surprised we see something actually. We could also perhaps consider increasing the probe dose, that might also give us better results?
20230515 - 0083:   Let's turn on stern gerlach
20230515 - 0084:   .. but keep the spinflipping on. Real faint this ones
20230515 - 0104:   60 ms sweep - 30 ms IR_tof
20230515 - 0122:   This was with 35 ms tof.
20230515 - 0132:   TOF iteration from 01,2,3,4,5 then 10,20,30..70 ms. (50 ms seep time, from 4 to 2 MHz, 210 mVrms). We put the SG with the tof so every run has differnet SG time. we correct this in the following iteration run
20230515 - 0133:   1
20230515 - 0134:   2
20230515 - 0135:   3
20230515 - 0136:   4
20230515 - 0137:   5
20230515 - 0138:   10
20230515 - 0139:   20
20230515 - 0140:   30 really interesting how it goes from the previous to this run in 10 ms
20230515 - 0141:   40
20230515 - 0142:   50
20230515 - 0143:   60 nothing anymore
20230515 - 0144:   70
20230515 - 0149:   Messy stuff
20230515 - 0150:   TOF from 1,2,4,..40 (steps of 2) and until 100 (steps of 10). same parameters as the las iteration but fixing the SG time for all runs
20230515 - 0151:   2
20230515 - 0152:   4
20230515 - 0156:   I think we're loosing the condensation
20230515 - 0162:   It's disapearing, it's gotta be the laser power/some similar effect killing it.
20230516 - 0003:   Seems stable enough almost
20230516 - 0006:   Looks fairly decent, go to ODT
20230516 - 0021:   This feels empty - not condensing enough
20230516 - 0022:   I suspect too much SternGerlach and a high tof, trying with lower sg to find sweet spot
20230516 - 0026:   Lasers unlocked?
20230516 - 0030:   Changed probe shut and it worked?
20230516 - 0036:   TOF_IR run starts here. 1ms
20230516 - 0037:   2ms
20230516 - 0038:   3ms
20230516 - 0039:   4ms
20230516 - 0040:   Is the trap flat or are atoms sloshing out of the side?5ms
20230516 - 0041:   10ms
20230516 - 0042:   20ms
20230516 - 0043:   30ms
20230516 - 0044:   40ms
20230516 - 0045:   50ms
20230516 - 0072:   no good spinor bec... ODTtime iteration from 1200 to 1500
20230517 - 0027:   Too much probe shut
20230517 - 0028:   20ms probe shut no luck
20230517 - 0029:   20ms probeshut looks good
20230517 - 0044:   Computer monitor and lights off
20230517 - 0045:   What is happening?
20230517 - 0056:   Pretty nice. Want to get rid of the stripy behaviour
20230517 - 0063:   Swapped SG back to probeshut channel - so in total, there should be longer time between the SG and imaging (perhaps too long here).
20230517 - 0068:   I checked aqnd the lasers are still lcoked
20230517 - 0069:   Yeah, possibly issues with pulses
20230517 - 0111:   
20230517 - 0112:   Go to OAH
20230517 - 0113:   First BEAM
20230517 - 0114:   Eh not too good, is it. Go to both beams
20230517 - 0115:   Loosing it. Also out of LN at this stage, could explain it.
20230517 - 0116:   pratically nothing
20230517 - 0126:   Why the hell is this so shit?
20230517 - 0127:   Would be worth spending a day optimizing the OAH. Perhaps tomorrow.
20230517 - 0132:   Smaller window size
20230517 - 0135:   OAH2 seems much less noisy than OAH1
20230517 - 0136:   Put most of the power in OAH1, less in OAH2 - mainly just the interference patter in OAH1 now, but still noisy - so the noise is not a function of the laser power, but something else.
20230517 - 0185:   Some optimization
20230519 - 0054:   Just the ref
20230519 - 0070:   No probe lol
20230519 - 0076:   Hm, it settles on the wrong peak
20230519 - 0087:   Check alignment of beam 1
20230519 - 0089:   Second one seem way better aligned.
20230519 - 0090:   Center seems to be at 1228, 992
20230519 - 0091:   Let's bring the other beam to that center as well.
20230519 - 0108:   Looks pretty, let's see in OAH
20230519 - 0111:   Good enough. Leave it here. Shame we have no condensates at this time to check, next week or maybe tomorrow.
20230522 - 0023:   Ultimate shit, let's wait a bit more though, to rule out initial stabilizing
20230522 - 0026:   fml
20230522 - 0027:   Ohh come onnnnnnnnn
20230522 - 0041:   blocked spinpol
20230522 - 0045:   No spin pol does what we expect no spinpol to do. Still low on particle numer hough
20230522 - 0046:   With spinpiol the particle number doubles or so, so that's good. But it's like a half from what we had last week.
20230522 - 0047:   Let's remeasure the laser powers.
20230522 - 0048:   Laser powers and alignment seems fine ...
20230522 - 0050:   fml still
20230522 - 0080:   It is a warmer day today, maybe something to do with that? I also have a theory - maybe it's the nitrogen, so I increased the flow by a lot now - to see if that improves the particle number
20230522 - 0085:   highest one today, this might be the LN effect
20230522 - 0086:   Maybe we touched something weirdly while optimizing the OAH. But this is strange, high LN flow seems to yield a higher particle number. This is just dripping LN. Let's leave it here for a bit, then push to extreme by openinig more
20230522 - 0087:   I'll look into the alignment of the zeeman beam
20230522 - 0096:   What the hell whyyyyyy. All I did here was change the sequence.
20230522 - 0106:   Top; 3oclock to 6oclock CW
20230522 - 0136:   Why is this emptyyyy, it has 5 seconds of probeshutter time
20230522 - 0137:   Godverdomme these channels
20230522 - 0140:   Alright, try go to OAH and fit these shots at 0 tof.
20230522 - 0141:   Ugh this shit again
20230522 - 0142:   First one has atoms, next ones not so much. Oh I need the MT trap to be on as well, of course.
20230522 - 0143:   Better - here, it slowly dissapears. We can even afford to cut the window a bit?
20230522 - 0144:   Perfect. Let's go with that, go to OAH. Ugh the laser powers for sure dropped, OAH seems not so powerful. Set the probe to 70 uW
20230522 - 0145:   Ugh not enough contrast - can't see the cloud. Only faint. Let's do more cooling to increase the phase space density.
20230522 - 0146:   Still not enough. Problem.
20230522 - 0147:   still faint
20230522 - 0148:   This doesn't work, let's go to absorption
20230522 - 0149:   This is even with RF2, almost looks like a condensate
20230522 - 0153:   Start the list in random order
20230522 - 0173:   Doesn't seem too nice.
20230522 - 0174:   But the particle numbers seem to fluctuate quite a lot.
20230522 - 0177:   Let's try optimize the zeeman mirror with this particle number
20230522 - 0182:   Fairly stable around 25M
20230522 - 0184:   T CW
20230522 - 0186:   too much/wrong direction. Let's go T CCW
20230522 - 0188:   T CCW
20230522 - 0192:   CCW a bit more
20230522 - 0198:   T CCW
20230522 - 0201:   Heyy
20230522 - 0206:   MT coils still on
20230522 - 0210:   T CCW
20230522 - 0212:   T CCW
20230522 - 0214:   T CCW a bit more
20230522 - 0215:   Maybe too far?
20230522 - 0222:   T CCW
20230522 - 0226:   Alright, let's go back T CW
20230522 - 0229:   B CW a bit
20230522 - 0232:   B CW
20230522 - 0235:   ugh
20230522 - 0236:   B CCW
20230522 - 0238:   Too far
20230522 - 0239:   Ugh stop here, continue tomorrow
20230523 - 0015:   Bottom, 5oclock to 6oclock, clockwise (CW). Higher than previous but let's see more runs
20230523 - 0019:   Bottom, 6oclock to 7oclock, clockwise (CW).
20230523 - 0020:   BAD - I'd say empty. Do you still have MOT?
20230523 - 0023:   Bottom, 7oclock to 4oclock, ACW
20230523 - 0024:   Clearer dip
20230523 - 0028:   Bottom 4oclock to 3oclock ACW
20230523 - 0029:   BAD
20230523 - 0031:   Bottom 3 to 3.5 oclock cw
20230523 - 0036:   bottom 3.5 t o4 cw
20230523 - 0042:   COUNT UP
20230523 - 0047:   bottom 4 to 5 cw
20230523 - 0053:   bottom 5 to 5.5 cw
20230523 - 0062:   bottom  5.5 to 6 cw
20230523 - 0063:   VERY BAD WHY
20230523 - 0064:   Figured it out - this was due to me decreasing N2 flow
20230523 - 0075:   7 to 5.5 bottom increase
20230523 - 0078:   Oh lets gooo
20230523 - 0083:   t_light affects the particle number. - run a list
20230523 - 0114:   Yeah okay, feels a bit false hah
20230523 - 0115:

20230523 - 0145:   Ewww
20230523 - 0148:   bottom 6 to 5 acw
20230523 - 0152:   No change made
20230523 - 0157:   It likes to bounce between 180M and 210M. No edits on my part. Waiting for it to settle down rn
20230523 - 0161:   bottom 5 to 5.5
20230523 - 0162:   not looking good - back up to 5 soon?
20230523 - 0164:   bottom 5.5 to 5
20230523 - 0167:   bottom down to 6
20230523 - 0168:   not good! move back up acw
20230523 - 0170:   acw bot 6 to 5
20230523 - 0174:   
20230523 - 0175:

20230523 - 0177:   
20230523 - 0178:   
20230523 - 0187:   ODT - no spinflipping yet
20230523 - 0188:   Looks good, fairly good actually, but it feels a bit ''pulled'' - perhaps the traps aren't aligned, there is no SG or anything of sorts. Also should be a lot of time for all magnetic fields to disapear
20230523 - 0189:   Spinflipping, but not much time of flight
20230523 - 0193:   Looks fairly nice
20230523 - 0194:   Looks condensed, no doubt - can do OAH here
20230523 - 0195:   narower?
20230523 - 0197:   Yeah, raising the cooling depth does indeed lower the condensation fraction. Good, at least we know roughly what's going on.
20230523 - 0198:   Still stripy
20230523 - 0199:   Saturated on the bottom - let's see in OAH.
20230523 - 0200:   In situ with absorption, the width is only about 10 pxs. So like 24 um
20230523 - 0201:   What is going on in the center? Defocused or unwrapping?
20230524 - 0095:   Lasers still locked?
20230524 - 0133:   What's going on?
20230524 - 0149:   B 12 to 1
20230524 - 0154:   B 1 to 3
20230524 - 0165:   B back 3 to 11 a lot of fluctuation, not stable
20230524 - 0175:   B 11 to 10 same as before not stable
20230524 - 0180:   B 10 to 9 better
20230524 - 0194:   9 to 7 Looks good
20230524 - 0201:   7 to 6
20230524 - 0208:   B 6 to 7.5
20230524 - 0212:

20230525 - 0035:   
20230525 - 0096:   Changed bottom 1oclock to 12 oclock ACW
20230525 - 0097:   Not good. Maybe torchlight so wait one more run.
20230525 - 0102:   bottom 12 to 11

20230525 - 0257:   doesnt seem to max out the camera - could have more particles ideally
20230525 - 0258:   no tof seems fine. not massive change from earlier
20230525 - 0259:   why is there no clear dip now?
20230525 - 0260:   dip now but not great
20230529 - 0010:   This is utter and absolute shit show
20230529 - 0015:   Bitch, let's start optimizing zeeman.
20230529 - 0018:   Start at bottom, clockwise
20230529 - 0022:   go ccw
20230529 - 0042:   go to top - clockwise
20230529 - 0045:   Oh come onn
20230530 - 0020:   Top 3 Bottom 2 START OPTIMIZATING

20230707 - 0096:   Little cooling, something is off. Cools too quickly.
20230707 - 0098:   Run the efficiency curves - cooling more and more
20230707 - 0108:   Empty
20230707 - 0109:   Empty.
20230707 - 0111:   Al lemptyy

20230707 - 0130:   Sadddd
20230707 - 0135:   Yess, way better - less RF cooling, nice condensate it seems, very nicel saturated
20230707 - 0136:   Let's also check the spin flipping
20230707 - 0139:   Check spinflipping
20230707 - 0141:   /
20230707 - 0155:   yep yep snipflipping works - mVrms - 200mV
20230707 - 0156:   still works
20230707 - 0173:   Looks interesting
20230707 - 0176:   Yep yep yep got it here. from here onwards

20230708 - 0018:   spinflp at 210 mVrms
20230708 - 0019:   spinflip at 220 mVrms  --> looks very decent, go to sdOAH
20230708 - 0046:   Turn off spinflip - we expect a contrast in the two beams
20230708 - 0048:   This is good new apparantely  - non spinflip
20230710 - 0005:   Leuk
20230710 - 0028:   Oh shit, pretty much lost it here 18s seems to be just over the edge - 2.42 Hz
20230710 - 0030:   Tau = -4

20230710 - 0046:   Gone here
20230710 - 0047:   Gone here
20230710 - 0048:   Tau of curevs = -1
20230710 - 0052:   empty already
20230710 - 0053:   empty
20230710 - 0054:   Tau = -2
20230710 - 0063:   Hm empty
20230710 - 0065:   tau -11
20230710 - 0084:   Didn't even lose it. Interesting. Go to tau -6
20230710 - 0176:   Still vertical and horizontal lines
20230710 - 0177:   !!! I mean this does look like we have three main domains if you ask me. This might be related to Bons' pictures
20230710 - 0179:   Oh super interesting
20230710 - 0180:   Oh interesting, it seems like there are less domains forming with odttime longer - so longer quench time, as Bons calls it
20230710 - 0181:   ODT Times way higher
20230710 - 0182:   This is with 10 seconds of ODT cooling, perhaps it's too much, because this seems very faint - so it seems like we're not cooling slow enough for the spin states to split, but not fast enough not to loose too many particles.Maybe faster initially, and slower later on? So increase the tau?
20230710 - 0190:   eh seems faint - small
20230710 - 0191:   same
20230710 - 0192:   shittttttt
20230710 - 0194:   Oh man still mega mega shit. We almost don't see it, I don't get it. Is it so small? Let's try also to take like 10 images to see some motion. Because this is just super horrible.
20230710 - 0195:   Maybe a bit better indeed. this is with 1000 ms odttime, no spinflip
20230710 - 0196:   10 frames. Ugh it disappears after a frame :o I should probably keep the ODT on of course
20230710 - 0197:   doesn't really seem to have any motion. Let's also do some with spinflip, just in case.
20230710 - 0201:   idk but the 100us imaging time is too much? weird thing again bleh
20230711 - 0014:   Woah looks promising
20230711 - 0026:   Pretty condensed, yeah
20230711 - 0029:   Condensate buddy
20230711 - 0033:   ODT - less particles with no cooling in odt - than in the TM
20230711 - 0035:   nice. lets more tof
20230711 - 0039:   Feels like we're loosing quite some particels durin the transfer. Maybe optimize the focus again?
20230711 - 0040:   stripes
20230711 - 0045:   maybe try to optimize the transfer to the odt by focusing
20230711 - 0066:   start top 8 bottom 3
20230711 - 0067:   top 8 to 9

20230711 - 0073:   T 10.5 to 9 (wierd, 9 before was better)
20230711 - 0074:   
20230711 - 0075:   T 9 to 7ish
20230711 - 0077:   7ish to 8
20230711 - 0078:   
20230711 - 0079:   8 to 8.75 ( random increase, looks like maximum is a bit above 8)
20230711 - 0080:   
20230711 - 0082:   nothing?

20230711 - 0107:   B 3ish
20230711 - 0118:   i ve moving bottom slighly arround 3
20230711 - 0133:   why is it damn decreasing again???
20230711 - 0157:   Dipole Cw a bit
20230711 - 0160:   CW a bit more
20230711 - 0165:   CCW
20230711 - 0181:   these lines gotta be spin solitons or spinitons
20230711 - 0184:   analyse as a function of odttime
20230711 - 0212:   Go to OAH without spinflippin
20230711 - 0214:   uf spinflipping really messes it up
20230711 - 0224:   go to OAH - focus at -0.002
20230711 - 0225:   Seems okay, pretty good in the OAH1 - NO spinflip
20230711 - 0226:   spinflip
20230711 - 0227:   spinflip
20230711 - 0228:   spinflip
20230711 - 0229:   spinflip
20230711 - 0230:   All these with spinflip. Try now without - see if there's any difference
20230711 - 0231:   No spinflip
20230711 - 0232:   No spinflip
20230711 - 0233:   No spinflip - goodish signal
20230711 - 0234:   No spinflip - might be useful to analyse the difference between the two signals and compare the two
20230711 - 0235:   No spinflip. Next with spinflip again. All these and below with probe power at 60-70 uW. Next going to 120-130 uW
20230711 - 0236:   Eh poor contrast - SPINFLIP
20230711 - 0237:   ! This might be as good as we had it - Spinflip
20230711 - 0238:   Going to higher odttimes to make less domains, and maybe we get some splitting
20230711 - 0239:   ehh
20230711 - 0240:   ! With more odttime - hopefully more solitons worth checking
20230711 - 0241:   Keep running it at these settings
20230711 - 0242:   no spinflip
20230711 - 0243:   no spinflip
20230711 - 0244:   Next one - changed the order of cooling and of spinflipping!
20230711 - 0245:   !! strong ish contrast, worth checking this one.  Keep in mind, this is spinflip before cooling. Might be interesting to see in absorption what this means
20230711 - 0246:   faint
20230711 - 0247:   still faint - let's maybe try some extra stern gerlach splitting, if we can, but without time of flight, but that's tricky :/ Or maybe multiple images. Or both
20230711 - 0248:   kay - go to 10 images, 2ms between, sterngerlach
20230711 - 0249:   empty
20230711 - 0250:   empty
20230711 - 0251:   empty - try without stern gerl
20230711 - 0252:   !! no SG -it's here
20230711 - 0253:   !! Ohh interestinggg - great contrast in the second one, but first one a bit messy
20230711 - 0254:   !! Anogther great one tbf - first one still a bit messy
20230711 - 0255:   !! starting to look better and better, but OAh 1 still acting out. Let's increase the time between shots
20230711 - 0256:   !!
20230711 - 0257:   !! increased the time between shots to 6 ms from 2 ms. And with motion, also first is better
20230711 - 0258:   set time in between shots from 6 ms to 20 (mnext)
20230711 - 0259:   !! all spinflip
20230711 - 0260:   !!
20230711 - 0261:   !! motion but different as others
20230711 - 0262:   !!
20230711 - 0263:   !!
20230711 - 0264:   !! not good contrast
20230711 - 0266:   fcked up again part 1 also part 2.
20230711 - 0267:   okayish
20230711 - 0268:   yeah, loosing it here
20230714 - 0007:   Hm, I think this is with polarity of comp coils inverted. As compared to the previous one.
20230714 - 0010:   Do the list of mot currents
20230714 - 0063:   Oh, pretty small. Let's hope it's big enough to test out the horizontal splitting.
20230714 - 0064:   promising - let's do some splitting. -first, just with spinflipping, to see how violent we are, then also SG in x direction. Need to flip the switch somewhere around the ODT cooling channel (once we are in the ODT, we can go for it).
20230714 - 0065:   This spinflipping is very violent
20230714 - 0066:   with SG in X, nothing here. Let's quickly check with the normal SG
20230714 - 0067:   Try more tof - nto obvious, but it feels like yes
20230714 - 0068:   spinflipping works - actually, wait, does it?
20230714 - 0069:   maybe a tiny shift downwards. Forgot the MOT was still on
20230714 - 0070:   eh, nothing. Let's try the other way (now at -10, go to 10)
20230714 - 0071:   Of course, -10 = 0 A in real terms. Now we go to 8 A (from typical 2)
20230714 - 0072:   Just a fuzz - nothing here
20230714 - 0073:   Nothing really it seems. Cool deeper and longer
20230714 - 0074:   Better, but no splitting, even at the highest field. I mean maybe some sort of a horizontal pattern, but eh eh. Try more TOF
20230714 - 0075:   Still vertical stripes though
20230714 - 0076:   Nothing - even at 35 ms tof - let's make sure that the spinflipping really really works
20230714 - 0077:   Not convinced - do better.
20230714 - 0078:   Eh somewhere in between. Go to 270 (from 250).
20230714 - 0079:   This weird thing again.
20230714 - 0080:   try 300 (also changed the cooling time and coolingdepth)
20230714 - 0081:   Go to 200
20230714 - 0082:   lots of nothing
20230714 - 0127:   Turned all the comp coils off - then MOT on and X comp on (to 5V)
20230714 - 0129:   Vertical splitting! For sure. Let's hope we get something more condensed to try out.
20230714 - 0130:   ! Vertical SG - Lovely. Still stripey. Very interesting.
20230714 - 0131:   ! Heey. Uf very funky. Why still stripey though
20230714 - 0133:   Lift XCOMP 5 to 10 V
20230714 - 0135:   Ohh what, allthree?
20230714 - 0137:   Eh
20230714 - 0140:   ! Woah
20230714 - 0146:   Splitting for sure
20230717 - 0016:   Funky - stripy, but no spinflipping though - so those are not Ketterle's domains? This must just be due to cooling rate imo.
20230717 - 0017:   No stripes all of a sudden - try again
20230717 - 0018:   No stripes again
20230717 - 0019:   No stripes again. Let's try the same but with spinflipping now.
20230717 - 0020:   Immediatelly stripes. What else changes? How come we have stripes also in non spin flipped case? What is going on?
20230717 - 0021:   Moved a bit, and also stripy - let's try with SG as well. And it seems we're also destroying it a bit with spinflip RF blasting
20230717 - 0022:   Interesting - seems also shifted a bit sideways, but all those fields should be zero.
20230717 - 0023:   ! Woahh - try some more time of flight
20230717 - 0024:   ! Ugh what the hell - there has got to be some other fields at work as well
20230717 - 0027:   What is going onnn
20230717 - 0030:   Just a quick drop in compz coils rather than slow ramp down
20230717 - 0032:   I wanna try everything the same, except no spinflipping
20230717 - 0033:   It's gotta be some sideways fields
20230717 - 0034:   No spiflipping, just SG. So this is the -1 state
20230717 - 0038:   Start the list with different tofs, to see the dynamics of the different spin components in the SG
20230717 - 0046:   Feeels like it's loosing the contrast a bit. Low particle number?
20230717 - 0048:   Stripes appearing, and it kinda seems like they are off-phase, if that makes sense
20230717 - 0052:   Ohh what, looks like an absorption/emission specter (with +1 state?)
20230717 - 0074:   Hmmm, what is the origin of these linessss. It also seems like there is a very specific center of the trap, where magnetic field is max where the cloud seems the most compressed.
20230717 - 0078:   There seems to be a drift along z direction as well. LEt's try to artificially balance it out with z comp coils
20230717 - 0081:   empty.
20230717 - 0089:   Lost it, empty
20230717 - 0090:   lasers got unlocked
20230717 - 0105:   No spinflipping here.
20230717 - 0108:   Good. Let's try play around with the z current here, and push it towards the center.
20230717 - 0110:   Nice. Shifted the other way now.
20230717 - 0111:   Interesting - roughly centered
20230717 - 0114:   Still a bit too much it seems, there's the shift to the right for the +1 state.
20230717 - 0116:   still a bit too much maybe? roughly there though
20230717 - 0117:   Not enough? This is at -7, let's go back to -6
20230717 - 0122:   Only -1 it seems
20230717 - 0172:   Check at 60s, seems fine - not brilliant, but fineish
20230717 - 0174:   Ugh just looks so sad and small
20230717 - 0180:   What the hell. Maybe cooling too much?
20230717 - 0183:   Hm, nothing in the IR trap it seems? Let's check at the end of MT - after RF2
20230717 - 0184:   Sad, way too little at this stage
20230717 - 0185:   Similar.
20230717 - 0187:   Start investigating the efficicency
20230717 - 0192:   Not too promising
20230717 - 0193:   vary rf cooling depth
20230717 - 0194:   Too far, too deep. Finding the condensation point first.
20230717 - 0198:   and this not yet there. So around here.
20230717 - 0200:   empty
20230717 - 0209:   absolute balls
20230717 - 0211:   
20230718 - 0041:   een beetje low
20230718 - 0042:   Turn Zeeman T CCW
20230718 - 0045:   T CCW
20230718 - 0046:   what the hellllll where are all the atoms. Power as yesterday, and also nitrogen flowing
20230718 - 0062:   This is max, but why so lowwww
20230718 - 0066:   Might be worth checking the laser powers again? Just to make sure
20230718 - 0069:   woah - turned the repumper to about 3.5 mW, made the difference. Interesting. Let's push further
20230718 - 0080:   further lowered the Zeeman repumper - (well dumped the rest in the MOT repumper)
20230718 - 0082:   what on earth - do more
20230718 - 0085:   went lower
20230718 - 0087:   Shit dude More less repumper
20230718 - 0089:   Alright, too little. Go back up.
20230718 - 0093:   shit dude - let's check what the power is here
20230718 - 0094:   just to check if this was due to higher power in the MOT repumper or lower power in the Zeeman repumper. We put the zeeman repumper to the old, 4.5 mW or so, and dumped the rest out. So MOT repumper the same as before, aroudn 10 mW, Zeeman at the (new) ideal value at ~0.8 mW
20230718 - 0096:   Okay, higher but lower than before. Let's really dump now all the power in the MOT repumper and optimize the incoupling.
20230718 - 0101:   try a bit lower (it was a bit lower before)
20230718 - 0103:   Bit less Zeeman repumper, bit more MOT
20230718 - 0115:   No spinflipping
20230718 - 0131:   good good. Enough cooling
20230718 - 0134:   Woahhh back to horizontal splitting - that's what I would call spin-drag?
20230718 - 0135:   So horizontal and vertical a bit - but both roughly the same size
20230718 - 0146:   increase MOT current from 1.9 to 3
20230718 - 0147:   not much difference. More? 3 to 6
20230718 - 0148:   !! Uu nice. pretty sharp on the top - try again. Top more squeezed than the bottom, as we expect.
20230718 - 0149:   Same as before - higher magnetic field gradient squeezes it more?
20230718 - 0150:   Alright, so the stronger the MOT field, more compressed the displaced cloud? Let's check this by decreasing it to like 2 V
20230718 - 0151:   So basically, stronger the gradient field, more quadratic it gets?
20230718 - 0152:   Yep - so stronger the MOT field, more compressed the little peak. Why could that be?
20230718 - 0153:   try even less, like 1V. Am I starting to lose the particles?
20230718 - 0155:   Still splitting, but still faint
20230718 - 0158:   I feel like we might have lost it a little bit. Check quickly what we have at 60
20230718 - 0162:   Looks half decent
20230718 - 0163:   Let's see what happens when we spinflip and then during the cooling we have comp-y only. Then, let's try to spinflip wrt y axis.
20230718 - 0164:   Alright, so nothing happened. Ooor, the displacement is in y  direction, which we cannot see, of course.
20230718 - 0171:   Almost no shift even though the tof is large and also the m fields are large. Increase MOT again?
20230718 - 0172:   Uf. More Z correction I guess
20230718 - 0179:   Only mf=-1
20230718 - 0182:   Less MOT, but seems like no spinflipping, really. Keep in mind, that this is with the channels swapped around -> first condensing, then spinflipping.
20230718 - 0183:   tripple splitting, all the same size. Oh interesting, maybe in the previous case we were only condensing one of the components, and not the other as well. Hmm strange.
20230718 - 0185:   184 to 185 -> z compensation coils to -5.5 -> shifts it less, of course.
20230718 - 0186:   But just the stripes are there all the time. No clue what's up with that
20230718 - 0188:   Set z comp to 0. This one is still at -5
20230718 - 0189:   Also not enough? Is this the z that displaces it? Maybe still some eddy currents from the finetune?
20230718 - 0192:   Ugh, this tells me nothing. What questions am I asking?
20230718 - 0194:   What, how does that make sense?
20230718 - 0195:   Run a list with z comp values
20230718 - 0200:   Is there any change at all?
20230718 - 0202:   Ugh did I set the wrong channel?
20230718 - 0203:   jep, wrong. Try again
20230718 - 0217:   Ugh it seems like nothing is changing
20230718 - 0221:   Interesting
20230718 - 0237:   nothin special.
20230718 - 0246:   Hm, so just turning on the IR trap doesn't seem to be good.
20230718 - 0247:   No IR ramp time, no wait.
20230718 - 0248:   Ugh, okay let's give it some time at least - IR ramp time = 0.2
20230718 - 0249:   Bit better, but still shit and still stripy. Try 0.5 s IR ramp time.
20230718 - 0255:   Let's check again at 60s.
20230720 - 0032:   Stripes. Quite some motion though it seems shot to shot
20230720 - 0033:   Stripy - without spinflipping
20230720 - 0034:   Less stripes.
20230720 - 0035:   Now let's turn off ALL the magnetic fields
20230720 - 0037:   All fields should be off, still stripes.
20230720 - 0067:   Bit shit, lowered from 20M to like 9M
20230720 - 0073:   Right, nitrogen back up
20230720 - 0074:   no stripes in the thermal cloud. Maybe if we try with less time of flight. But it's clear we're not condensing yet in the ODT.
20230720 - 0075:   Nice condensate, but it seems that it has stripes on the edge only. Oh interesting.
20230720 - 0077:   Less tof - seems like some grid like pattern :o
20230720 - 0080:   griddy griddy
20230720 - 0084:   Yeah for sure there is something going on in vertical and horizontal direction
20230720 - 0085:   but then the condensed one immediatelly very stripy. This is with all magnetic fields off, btw
20230720 - 0087:   yeah shit, the pattern is there, All fields gone for more than a second, including compensation coils.
20230720 - 0089:   What the hell man. Let's try with a higher cooling depth - or lower perhaps?
20230720 - 0092:   ! Woah
20230720 - 0094:   Woah, so lowered the depth of the trap (to 0.5, from 0.7) and that produces more lines?
20230720 - 0096:   Gosh it's looking funkier and funkier. Let's do a list
20230720 - 0097:   empty.
20230720 - 0114:   still some pattern visible imo
20230720 - 0118:   still very stripy. Ugh
20230720 - 0141:   Still stripes, even at 10 seconds cooling.
20230720 - 0142:   Thermal cloud in 10 ms tof. Stripes.
20230720 - 0145:   still stripy even at depth of 2
20230720 - 0146:   At higher cooling limit - should be a mixture of sorts - cooling depth at 2. Go to 2.5
20230720 - 0148:   Yeah can tell it's a mixture. But even then, still stripy. It's gotta be the trap, right?
20230720 - 0151:   Yeah on the brink - mainly thermal
20230720 - 0173:   woah
20230720 - 0178:   Super stripy. This is at a lower trap value. Let's try increasing the time inside the IR trap by increasing the probeshut time. But I guess that is just the same as making the odttime longer, since it gets fairly flat towards the end of the cooling curve.
20230720 - 0183:   No difference. Just this weird profile. Ugh .
20230720 - 0186:   mjeh
20230720 - 0188:   mainly lines on the right side
20230720 - 0193:   All three, now the stripes even more apparent. Let's keep in trap for a second before SGing
20230720 - 0194:   Feels like less stripes but nothing changed. Grr. Next one with more hold time
20230720 - 0195:   lesss, but still that checkerboard pattern
20230720 - 0197:   still stripes. Longer hold time in the trap does not change anything
20230720 - 0198:   Same same. Lines everywhere.
20230721 - 0024:   still a bit low - oven should be warmed up by now
20230721 - 0048:   Hey buddy. Yeah. the tlight was too high
20230721 - 0054:   Is it stripy though?
20230721 - 0055:   Definetely some stripes. - try with some different ramp times and see if that affects the thermal cloud
20230721 - 0056:   seems like some weird checkerboard pattern
20230721 - 0059:   Same pattern even with 3s IR ramp.
20230721 - 0061:   Also with the pinchbias off. Let's try with cooling
20230721 - 0062:   Pretty big, man I wish I had a grip on what's going on with the stripes haha. No stripes visible here, but low tof
20230721 - 0063:   Feeels like some stripes want to emerge on the right side, but we'll need more time of flight than that.
20230721 - 0064:   Yeah if you squint you can see some sort of a pattern emerging. We can try the OAH thing Jasper suggested and try to see if the position of the high density regions is stable.
20230721 - 0065:   Goodness, yes prety obviously something is going on. Might be the alignment between the traps?
20230721 - 0066:   Let me just blast it with RF, no quantization axis, no SG splitting. Just want to see the effects of the spinflipping on stripiness.
20230721 - 0071:   SF
20230721 - 0072:   noSF Ohh interesting! So it does seem like it is the spinflipping which makes the lines. This is all the same, but without blasting withRF (so finetune on, no spinflip). Compare with previous one where there are lines (with spinflipping). I mean there still is pattern present here ,but a bit larger scale I'd say
20230721 - 0073:   Ugh I mean some lines still here. But definetely not as much as when we spinflip. Let's SF again.
20230721 - 0074:   Maybe spinflipping just accentuates the features?
20230721 - 0075:   Spinflipping does something to it - time to play around with the spinflipping parameter settings? Or oculd be the quantization axis, shall we try direct it in the x axis? Try the same but without any magnetic field first.
20230721 - 0076:   Right. Next one with finetune off - comp coils stay on though. WAIT MOT coils are not at zero??? During the spinflipping, no they are off, since the MOT switch is off. Uf, close call
20230721 - 0077:   Nothing without finetune. Interesting. - do the same, but with YCOMP instad of FT coils to make the quantization axis.
20230721 - 0078:   nothing really. Maybe try to ramp up the FT less? First with normal FT
20230721 - 0079:   Yep, stripes back as expected. Let's do a list where we go through the different values of finetune values. Starting the list.
20230721 - 0131:   >
20230721 - 0132:   Investigate the role of the finteune vars
20230721 - 0133:   <
20230721 - 0186:   why so shit
20230721 - 0188:   vertical, but squeezed
20230721 - 0189:   Try without MOT - only comp coils now. We expect nothing, since it's a homogoneous field. But if there is something overlying we might see it.
20230721 - 0190:   Nothing, as expected. But stripy.
20230721 - 0191:   Nothing really, like expected. But stripy.
20230721 - 0192:   Try with P/B coils rather than MOT coils. THey should also be in antihelmholtz, right?
20230721 - 0193:   nosing, try more current?
20230721 - 0195:   Nothing. try with a MOT ramp.
20230724 - 0003:   Man this is crazy.
20230724 - 0010:   Lovely - so like 40% efficiency, is that reasonable?
20230724 - 0012:   Pretty nice looking.Stripey on the right again. This has got to be something.
20230724 - 0015:   Not as compressed as the next one
20230724 - 0016:   Top super compressed, only time of flight changed.
20230724 - 0017:   Seems to have some z component, from where. I want to try something funky, keep the finetune on while MOT and XCOMP
20230724 - 0021:   
20230724 - 0023:   0 V - Iteration SG gradient final depth from 0 to 8 V (all comp mag fields 0)
20230724 - 0024:   
20230724 - 0025:   
20230724 - 0026:   
20230724 - 0027:   the stiper the MOT curve, do not increase separation?
20230724 - 0028:   
20230724 - 0029:   
20230724 - 0043:   Change tof to 15 and change MOT current to 2
20230724 - 0045:   Try with normal values of compensation coils -> to make sure we compensate for the earths magnetic field
20230724 - 0046:   mmkay, lets try with some x bias field
20230724 - 0050:   Hm, but the shapes seem okay?
20230724 - 0088:   empty
20230724 - 0147:   0 - iteration raising SG V (and x comp -10)
20230724 - 0148:   1
20230724 - 0149:   2
20230724 - 0150:   3
20230724 - 0155:   
20230724 - 0156:   0 - iteration raising SG V (and x comp value continue)
20230724 - 0159:   3 V --> limit  separation ditance
20230724 - 0165:   SG from 0 to 3 V  (and x comp value continue)
20230725 - 0003:   Nice getting there
20230725 - 0024:   SG 5 V
20230725 - 0025:   SG 5 V
20230725 - 0026:   SG 3 V
20230725 - 0027:   SG 2 V - idk what i am looking
20230725 - 0028:   SG 2 V
20230725 - 0029:   SG 0 V
20230725 - 0035:   low SG... why spread and almsot nothing?
20230725 - 0038:   0 SG
20230725 - 0047:   5 SG and spin flipping
20230725 - 0048:   5 SG without spin flipping ... wow
20230725 - 0049:   5 SG without spin flipping
20230725 - 0079:   start iteration tof no flipping
20230725 - 0094:   start iteration tof flipping
20230725 - 0110:   Low particle number - get the powers up I assume
20230725 - 0116:   the helllll, powers should be fine
20230726 - 0000:   
20230726 - 0010:   Back in, baby
20230726 - 0012:   
20230726 - 0014:   Straight to dipole trap - no spinflipping, and also no finetune magnetic field - I want to see if we still get the stripes (I suspect that with finetune we somehow polarize the atoms)
20230726 - 0015:   Still stripy. Might be worth during different stages of cooling? Also, check if stripes in thermal cloud - also, check for splititing in thermal cloud
20230726 - 0016:   8M condensate in ODT :o Oh man, I wish our shit worked and we had it figured out. Oh wait, there are still some magentic fields
20230726 - 0018:   Seems like no stripes here. Something seems to be trying to get started towards the edge, though.
20230726 - 0020:   Stripes here. There goes my theory. Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyy. So not spin related? Let's try SG without spinflipping
20230726 - 0022:   Yeah, def stripy - but for some reason it seems different than when using spinflipping. Maybe we are still spinflipping
20230726 - 0024:   With SG - look at the shape though - very normal (bi more circular due to larger tof)
20230726 - 0028:   Mmkay, finetune coils on, but nothing changes
20230726 - 0029:   same same
20230726 - 0030:   Now spinflipping.
20230726 - 0035:   Nothing? Oh the PS for spinflipping is offf
20230726 - 0038:   Ugh yeah, this is strange.- spinflipping - wait so not the problem with magnetic fields?
20230726 - 0045:   Wait maybe there isn't any decompression, but we just pull out this thin slice? Let's play around with slower/faster quench times
20230726 - 0046:   Bit much
20230726 - 0047:   Bit much
20230726 - 0049:   Empty
20230726 - 0057:   Just lower? Why tho? Let's check the laser powers
20230726 - 0060:   Why lowerrr where am I loosing it? Problems seem to come after re-locking the F=1 laser
20230726 - 0062:   Fuckerrr
20230726 - 0065:   Shiteee
20230726 - 0067:

20230726 - 0087:   wierd ups and downs

20230726 - 0090:   
20230726 - 0091:   246
20230726 - 0187:   Nah this is gone
20230731 - 0001:   Bleh. Come on dude
20230731 - 0028:   Mm okay
20230731 - 0036:   Change RF curves
20230731 - 0046:   Shit? Why
20230731 - 0047:   Is maybe the laser on? The channle is on, but I believe that the analog group should be set to 0 anyway
20230731 - 0049:   No, not the problem with the laser on. Let's check the laser powers again
20230731 - 0062:   The fuck man? Can't be the laser, we optimized that to 120, which is even higher than initial 115ish. Perhaps play around a bit with the repumper? Now set at 0.8
20230731 - 0069:   I mean kinda getting up? But I don't get this, why are we loosing atoms all of a sudden
20230731 - 0105:   Ugh
20230731 - 0133:   Huh? - I mean this actually just looks empty -  Changed the script to something way older. Oh the MOT current different? Gotta be other stuff as well
20230731 - 0158:   Higher repumper
20230731 - 0164:   What the fuck. Maybe lost the lock, could be.
20230731 - 0166:   might be too much repumper, try less? But why would we need so little?
20230731 - 0167:   or not
20230731 - 0175:   Fuck man, in the afternoon it just becomes unusable. This is at low tof as well
20230731 - 0178:   A bit better indeed, but it still seems like the particle number is fluctuating on some few minute scales.
20230731 - 0181:   empty.
20230731 - 0185:   Lost it again?
20230731 - 0190:   Moved, but so so faint.
20230731 - 0191:   well, spinflipping. Let's try now the Ketterle method where we only apply MOT field after 5 ms.
20230731 - 0192:   Ugh. No atoms. Something brings the numbers down throughout the day. Try maybe less repumper and check at 60 sec?
20230731 - 0194:   Interesting. Seems to help a bit
20230731 - 0198:   BLah what shit is this
20230731 - 0200:   back to 60 sec
20230731 - 0217:   what whyyyy
20230731 - 0220:   empty. - optimzin the repumper now
20230731 - 0225:   back CCW
20230731 - 0227:   CCW
20230731 - 0247:   funky
20230801 - 0002:   Pretty good - the laser power is like 110 mW and the repumper at 1 mW
20230801 - 0005:   Quick to ODT while we still can. Try the thingy.
20230801 - 0008:   Laser on - empty :(
20230801 - 0010:   Okay, just the lasers got unlocked. Let's go
20230801 - 0012:   Oh nice, but still squished I believe - try more tof
20230801 - 0014:   Massive. Very interesting tho.
20230801 - 0015:   Play around with different times of flight
20230801 - 0016:   !! Shape staysssss
20230801 - 0017:   Is being pulled appart, but no domains :/
20230801 - 0018:   Goes up - no domains though.
20230801 - 0019:   Try slower cooling and also, move the 5ms wait time in tof to something like 8ms to see if we need more time for the mean field energy to release
20230801 - 0020:   More tof.
20230801 - 0023:   No big change with domains :/  Maybe go through a tof list? Maybe long probe shut time (go to 300 rather than 40 ms)
20230801 - 0024:   hehe penis. Feels like it's the same lines that are pulled up. Does this mean we're condensing before we're spinflipping? Could be?
20230801 - 0025:   Same also with more tof. Let's get rid of cooling and check if we do indeed only have the thermal cloud after spinflipping
20230801 - 0026:   This is with spinflipping but only like 5ms of SG
20230801 - 0027:   but for sure this is just thermal cloud.
20230801 - 0028:   No movement really.
20230801 - 0030:   Maybe quantization axis no bueno?
20230801 - 0032:   Seems like the problem now are the domains - why can't we make just a few big ones?
20230801 - 0034:   I mean looks really nice haha
20230801 - 0035:   Spinflipping and cooling inverted here. - nothing is spinflipped really.
20230801 - 0036:   Everything moves. Get rid of the com coils (bring them in during SG)
20230801 - 0037:   Interesting, now there is some splitting and domains. So something to do with the comp coils?
20230801 - 0042:   Oh alright
20230801 - 0046:   Woah what the fuck. Vertical mode?
20230801 - 0047:   Try waiting longer in tof before SGing
20230801 - 0050:   Quite a squeeze. What the hell. Where from? Try more tof
20230801 - 0051:   Let's see what happens if we lower the finetune slowly. Here we just bring it down immediately.
20230801 - 0053:   Nah this weird as hell.
20230801 - 0061:   WOAH what the hell is this? Completley out of focus?
20230801 - 0065:   Ugh seems like we're losing the particle number again.
20230801 - 0066:   not enough finetune current
20230801 - 0067:   Ugh now this is with way more finetuning current, same story?
20230801 - 0104:   Still stripey. Let's try cool slower, for real now (before it was more like thold).
20230801 - 0118:   Even with no spinflipping the condensate could still be stripy due to spin-related things. There are mf=0 collisions which can produce mf=-1 and mf=+1 pairs
20230801 - 0123:   domains have to have something to do with the magnetic field
20230801 - 0128:   Maybe we need the magnetic field on during the cooling stage? That would make sense, right
20230801 - 0129:   Ketterle claims that the lines are indeed alternating -1 0 domains. So putting both cloud on top of one another should give us a single  tf distribution, in principle
20230801 - 0134:   Egh - seems like it's compressing again
20230801 - 0136:   Still seems to be conpressing, yeah.
20230801 - 0137:   Maybe somehow trying to split? up down?
20230801 - 0144:   egh empty
20230801 - 0165:   Seems like no stripes. Finetune is on though
20230801 - 0166:   let's check what actually messes it up - is it spinflipping blast?
20230801 - 0174:   I mean this is still fine
20230801 - 0175:   All fields are off, still stripy, still the metastable thing.
20230802 - 0038:   Ugh but why so shit
20230802 - 0043:   particle number dropped. Back to the lab
20230802 - 0050:   what the helllll
20230802 - 0052:   fuck off
20230802 - 0172:   start rotating
20230802 - 0220:   In the ODT, but very poor condensate.
20230802 - 0224:   nothng. Bye
20230803 - 0012:   of course.
20230803 - 0033:   Just a bit messed up - violently
20230803 - 0034:   Before condensing, let's apply the force to pull spins apart.
20230803 - 0035:   Still messy but maybe? Try more tof to be sure. Also maybe longer force time?
20230803 - 0036:   !!! Wait wait wait wait what what maybe maybe?
20230803 - 0037:   This might be working!!! Now just for the fucked up shapes.
20230803 - 0040:   Still, the shapes a bit messy, but it does seem like I'm pulling the condensate apart in half. This looks good!
20230803 - 0041:   Weird shapes persist. That's another issue.
20230803 - 0046:   Back to old ways. Also, try to see with keeping the MOT coils on during the cooling.
20230803 - 0086:   Lower MOT current - but still the time of pull is 60 ms. We could try less time, or even less current
20230803 - 0098:   fuck :)
20230803 - 0101:   
20230803 - 0112:   
20230803 - 0114:   nice
20230803 - 0115:   shit
20230803 - 0127:   absolute bollocks

20230804 - 0046:   Forgot to turn on the spinpol wavegenerator
20230804 - 0056:   Nothing obvious
20230804 - 0060:   I mean something feels like it's moving, but bleh
20230908 - 0000:   Back in the lab, things as we left them, unfortunatelly.
20230908 - 0003:   Slightly lower even. Zeeman power at 130 mW, repumper at 1.3
20230908 - 0011:   Fucking hell, this is shit
20230908 - 0048:   Base line, let's check at like 5s RF1
20230908 - 0051:   at 5s, try and optimize here.
20230908 - 0079:   T CW

20230911 - 0247:   Zeeman still at ~120 mW, repumper at 1.3 mW
20230911 - 0248:   Check at 60 sec
20230911 - 0356:   Run hrough the list of xcompdac_mot
20230911 - 0410:   dipole still where I left it <3
20230911 - 0413:   stripes also where I left them -.-
20230911 - 0415:   Try with spinflipping and SG
20230911 - 0418:   Big and looks good, but no SG. I believe everything should be on, I'll go check again. Stripes still there.
20230911 - 0419:   
20230911 - 0420:   Everything is on. Definetely shift of -1, but doesn't seem like anything in 0 state.
20230911 - 0421:   Also that massive squeezing happening. Also, the stripes are in the squeezed state. Spinflip time was set to 40ms, so maybe we werent going through the transition. Try again.
20230911 - 0422:   Christ, even more squeezed than I remember it - we did change the compensation values, remember - maybe that?
20230911 - 0423:   more tof. try now to turn off all all coils. Except MOT which we need for SG. but also, there is some residual magnetic field, so hm, not sure if that's best
20230911 - 0424:   These at 240mV. Goes the other way. There is some of the other component. Go to 210mW for the next one.
20230911 - 0425:   210mV - shifted downwards. Go to 200.
20230911 - 0426:   210, go to 310mV
20230911 - 0428:   to 250
20230911 - 0430:   laser got unlocked
20230911 - 0431:   Titled sideways. Let's loop through tofs.
20230911 - 0433:   list throguh tofs.
20230912 - 0002:   Play aruond with repumper
20230912 - 0031:   repumper too low it seems. Here at like 0.6 mW. Go to 12+2 (MOT R and Zeeman R)
20230913 - 0092:   Try this without spinflipping, to see if that faint shaddow is some spin component effect or some potential landscape
20230913 - 0107:   Shadow even with no spinflipping still there, let's try a loop from 0 to 30 or something.
20230913 - 0108:   List go from here
20230913 - 0109:   No tof, it's there? huh ? Also it looks super small. Looks like it's leaking
20230913 - 0110:   uf, try again, with SG off (mot channel off)
20230913 - 0111:   This is no MOT coils. And no shaddow, so it has to be something with the MOT coils. Try less strong.
20230913 - 0112:   So weird.
20230913 - 0119:   Might be a good idea to image in OAH in the trap, and check if it moves.
20230913 - 0125:   Hm, it doesn't seem that the MOT current is large enough
20230913 - 0130:   Forgot hold - so now it's 50ms tof
20230913 - 0135:   List here. Let's check the laser powers, then list through tofs at those settings.

20230914 - 0002:   These are all at 75 mW of Zeeman power :o 1.5 mW of Zeeman repump.
20230914 - 0003:   okay, better. This is at 125ish mW
20230914 - 0007:   But then it doesn't go anywhere
20230914 - 0014:   stripy
20230914 - 0015:   Hm, maybe the initial movement is because the MT is not aligned with the ODT? Should be easy to check without SG
20230914 - 0049:   try with inverted polarity. Hopefully this will give us some information on the state of the coils
20230914 - 0050:   This just looks like no MOT coils tbh.s
20230914 - 0051:   Oh hm not quite. This is the same without the MOT coils
20230914 - 0053:   with flipped polarity, this is a mess.
20230914 - 0056:   MOT maybe on too much (also before)
20230914 - 0099:   inverted polarity, am I doing it correclty.
20230914 - 0112:   empty - MOT on but at 0 value, so should be the same as before.
20230914 - 0113:   oh man a birdieeee
20230914 - 0116:   Alright, well that's something. Let's do a list
20230914 - 0195:   to 210 mVrms
20230914 - 0199:   Good, better splitting. - 300 mVrms
20230914 - 0202:   go to 100ms spinflipping time - maybe slower ramp spinflips more particels?
20230914 - 0203:   ney. Go to 45 ms
20230915 - 0005:   The laser power probably at like 70 or something. Let's improve that and then ODT
20230915 - 0013:   200 mVrms
20230915 - 0014:   220 mVrms
20230915 - 0015:   220 mVrms
20230915 - 0016:   240 mVrms
20230915 - 0018:   okay, this looks prety good I'd say. Still stripy tho
20230915 - 0020:   Loojks like good spin flipping, but not great SG, of course. let's turn on comp coils.
20230915 - 0021:   alright, with mot X coils we can shift it upwards (relative to the image). But still, compression. Try less tof.
20230915 - 0022:   !! Nice actually. Now, here, we can try with nice separation preparation. This would be interestng to see if we can match it.
20230915 - 0023:   I mean at first sight it for sure seems like they should overlap. Would also be itneresting to do a list of tofs.
20230915 - 0024:   Not sure here. At 5 ms tof hard to tell. Go to 10 and try to do some spin pulling.
20230915 - 0025:   !!! Shitttt this looks good? This might be it? try a bit longer pull. I think this is it my man!
20230915 - 0026:   Promising. The shapes are too similar though, so it seems like they might have still overlapped. We are missing that sharp edge. But with a tof list, this should work.
20230915 - 0027:   15 ms spinpull time. Let's go to 20
20230915 - 0028:   go to 20ms spinpull
20230915 - 0029:   !!! Oh this is good, this is working!! Might want to be a bit more efficient with spinflipping
20230915 - 0032:   Oh lovely, this is 50ms at 1V spinpull. Try 2V at 100 ms spinpull
20230915 - 0033:   Want to figure out if it's better to do higher voltage for shorter time, or lower voltage for longer time (or higher for longer)
20230915 - 0036:   5ms seems to be enough?
20230915 - 0037:   And this is without the spinpull. try 15ms / 5V
20230915 - 0038:   Helloww. This looks convincing. try like 10V for 15 ms
20230915 - 0039:   try to optimize the spinflipping
20230915 - 0041:   stripes persist though. It makes me thing that this is the laser problem. I think our dipole trap is ribbed
20230915 - 0043:   Go to 100ms sweep time at 270 mVrms
20230915 - 0044:   Too efficient flipping? Ugh, I really thing that the trap is not good, and that causes the stripes
20230915 - 0049:   !! Like not perfect, but pretty good. Try at 280ms
20230915 - 0050:   List here and lunch
20230915 - 0071:   Hm, maybe it kinda looks like alright, but let's try again. Check how the particle nubmer looks like
20230915 - 0110:   empty
20230915 - 0117:   run it at 13ms tof for a while.
20230915 - 0131:   Oh of course, the 0 state doesn't get moved. So those are still at the position of -1's, we need to figure out something else. Maybe if we initialize in +1 and -1 only.
20230915 - 0132:   Oh woah. Not sure what this is actually. But seems like we can see three clouds. So what I'm doing here is spinpulling before we do any spinflipping. My logic is that the spin components will separate better. idk, probably not. Oh no I wanted to do before condensing, but we were doing that anyway. Oh maybe after condensing then?
20230915 - 0133:   Let's now try to spinpull after condensing. That makes more sense, right? Actually no, the first makes more sense, ugh
20230918 - 0019:   Feels like the probe is weak
20230918 - 0020:   !! But the splittnig is here. Nice.
20230918 - 0021:   Put it to 100 uW
20230918 - 0024:   Almost no flipping. 50 ms one way sweep, 50 ms the other way.
20230918 - 0025:   try a bit less of tof
20230918 - 0026:   Try to switch polarity of the MOT coils during the spinpull - should put the different states on opposite sides, right?
20230918 - 0027:   Nothing, lol
20230918 - 0028:   No spinflipping, still SG
20230918 - 0029:   same. Just to check if ODT cooling is doing what we think it is. Now let's try without. Some stripes though
20230918 - 0030:   Try without SG, then try without cooling,.
20230918 - 0031:   No SG. Not too big.
20230918 - 0032:   Very stripy. Let's check wihtout cooling, if stripes there as well, then it has to be the trap problems, if not we can suspect the cooling perhaps?
20230918 - 0033:   yeah lekker, not condensed, and seems like no stripes here. Let's check at less tof
20230918 - 0036:   I mean seem like some vertical lines. Odd. But no obvious lines, so has to be in the cooling? Or are we just setting the atoms lower in the trap when cooling, so it could also still be the trap issues.
20230918 - 0038:   Let's see how low is our transition termperature in the ODT
20230918 - 0055:   Not condensed at 5V - go to 4
20230918 - 0056:   empty. Did I lose it?
20230918 - 0064:   How is it possible that we see something at 0 cooling depth - I guess it's kindof such a long time of flight, like around 60ms or whatever.
20230918 - 0065:   stripesssss - cooling depth 0 though ?
20230918 - 0067:   Stripes here as well.
20230918 - 0074:   Here's where the condensation appears.
20230918 - 0101:   Faint. Try normal cooling times, perhaps even shorter, to see if the effect get's bigger. But then do a longer hold, longer wait time.
20230918 - 0102:   Seems worse than before. Check pnum at 60
20230918 - 0107:   Go check laser powers.
20230918 - 0120:   I literally ramped the powers for 50% and nothing changed
20230918 - 0121:   Somewhere we're losing particles, and it's not in the lasers.
20230918 - 0130:   Shit show
20230918 - 0144:   repumper too strong?
20230918 - 0156:   Stripy. Okay, I want to investigate this movement idea I have. So, if the condensate is moving, after being released, how could I see that? Perhaps OAH? Feels like we have less stripes now though. But nothing changed lol.
20230918 - 0161:   snowman :o no spinpull, very stripy.
20230918 - 0163:   only one way sweep
20230918 - 0178:   stripes all the way
20230918 - 0182:   where did you gooo
20230918 - 0197:   No spinflipping, no SG. Little stripy. let's leave it a bit after cooling - increase probeshut time
20230918 - 0199:   damn, longer times, even more stripy. Go to even more probeshut
20230918 - 0201:   does seem a bit more homogenous
20230918 - 0202:   it again seems like there is the stripy pattern appering at the edge - some sort of an interference? And for sure there is some sort of a motion
20230918 - 0203:   nevermind, stripy as hell.
20230918 - 0204:   Seems like no more stripes? Interesting
20230918 - 0212:   this is 800 ms thold, more stripes, but also movement. For sure. How do we tackle that?
20230919 - 0001:   Ugh what? Maybe the nitrogen not yet in good flow?
20230919 - 0002:   Let's give it a sec
20230919 - 0005:   Nah, if anything this is getting worse. Looks sad.
20230919 - 0015:   kay, going up
20230919 - 0020:   Good, better
20230919 - 0091:   !! Ohh shittt look at that
20230919 - 0092:   !!!! Yesss this is the one! Printable
20230919 - 0115:   empty
20230919 - 0117:   back
20230919 - 0120:   Oh lets goo
20230919 - 0154:   start opt amplitud RF ( looking for the best 50/50 comp -1 and 0)
20230919 - 0155:   290 mV
20230919 - 0157:   300 mV
20230919 - 0158:   305 mV (seems best shot
)
20230919 - 0159:   310 mV
20230919 - 0160:   315 mV
20230919 - 0161:   320 mV (the more ampl, the bigger 1 comp)
20230919 - 0162:   325 mV
20230919 - 0163:   330 mV
20230919 - 0164:   285 mV
20230919 - 0165:   280 mV
20230919 - 0166:   275 mV (lower the ampl-->seems bad performance)
20230919 - 0167:   270 mV
20230919 - 0168:   305 mV  (now looks horrible of course)
20230919 - 0171:   
20230919 - 0172:   start opt Rf sweep time ( looking for the best 50/50 comp -1 and 0)
20230919 - 0173:   --------- 60 ms at 290 mV sweep
20230919 - 0174:   -
20230919 - 0175:   -
20230919 - 0176:   -
20230919 - 0177:   -
20230919 - 0180:   20 ms
20230919 - 0184:   30 ms
20230919 - 0185:   i see nothing, lets look at 60 s
20230919 - 0189:   why when i go to lower spin sweep times, instead of not sweep, do i loose the bec? sweep too fast destroys bec?
20230919 - 0190:   60 ms (we get the bec back hahahaah lol)
20230919 - 0191:   (super unstable wtf)
20230919 - 0192:   
20230919 - 0193:   65 ms
20230919 - 0196:   70 ms
20230919 - 0200:   75 ms
20230919 - 0204:   80 ms
20230919 - 0207:   85 ms
20230919 - 0212:   in contrast as last time we studied the sweep time, the change of the time does not make a lot of differences.. wierd
20230919 - 0213:   ------ lets change the amp too 210mV and 60 ms, as in may, to see what happens ----
20230919 - 0214:   interresting
20230919 - 0216:   65 ms 210 mV
20230919 - 0219:   70 ms at 210 mV
20230919 - 0221:   75 ms at 210 mV
20230919 - 0224:   80 ms ( in may we had eveything 0 comp wuth this same configuration)
20230919 - 0230:   reverse the sweep.. now from 2 --> 4 MHz
20230919 - 0239:   4 --> 2 MHz 60 ms 290 mV
20230919 - 0242:   2 --> 4 MHz 60 ms 290 mV
20230919 - 0244:   4 --> 2 MHz 60 ms 210 mV
20230919 - 0245:   4 --> 2 MHz 50 ms /  2 --> 4 MHz 40 ms / 290 mV
20230919 - 0247:   2 --> 4 MHz 50 ms /  4 --> 2 MHz 40 ms / 290 mV
20230920 - 0002:   I wanna run it a bit to see if we still have that oscillation
20230920 - 0003:   interesting
20230920 - 0020:   !! My goodness look at this
20230920 - 0028:   Oh lovely lovely
20230920 - 0033:   lil bit, but like also in the +1
20230920 - 0035:   try different sweep
20230920 - 0041:   !!! I mean this looks so so good. could be a poster, but too man components.
20230920 - 0042:   try also back sweep
20230920 - 0059:   We can afford to cool a bit more.
20230920 - 0061:   Ughm not too good. Let's change the RF curves. Might be worth optimizing.
20230920 - 0103:   start rf2 list to analyze the efficiemcy every 3 seconds and seee if there are steps were we can optimize it
20230920 - 0130:   The RF2 curve does not seem to be really influenced on the shape, but more on the duration and final freq
20230920 - 0131:   
20230920 - 0132:   260 mV 50 ms 4-->2 MHz
20230920 - 0133:   260 mV 60 ms 4-->2 MHz
20230920 - 0135:   260 mV 65 ms 4-->2 MHz

20230920 - 0140:   260 mV 55 ms 4-->2 MHz
20230920 - 0141:   wierd, from 60ms and below it does not work
20230920 - 0142:   260 mV 60 ms 4-->2 MHz
20230920 - 0143:   260 mV 50 ms 4-->2 MHz
20230920 - 0144:   260 mV 50 ms ( 60 in cicero) 4-->2 MHz
20230920 - 0145:   260 mV 30 ms ( 60 in cicero) 4-->2 MHz

20230920 - 0160:   260 mV 5 ms 2-->4 MHz (reverse)
20230921 - 0000:   Well, not off to a good start, but I think the laser powers are a bit low, and also nitrogen still not fully flowing
20230921 - 0004:   I guess scratch that, all is good haha
20230921 - 0010:   Cool cool, let's go to ODT
20230921 - 0012:   Bleh. Might be the wrong scanning parameters
20230921 - 0028:   Some funky motion
20230921 - 0030:   !!!!! Oh my godddd that's the poster one  290mVrms, 50ms sweep (60 in cicero), 4 - 2 MHz
20230921 - 0031:   try sweeping the other way
20230921 - 0032:   these are opposite sweeps - try like 500 mVrms
20230921 - 0033:   Oh what, this is sweep 2->4 with 500 mVrms amplitude. I get all three components. - also some return time
20230921 - 0036:   Interesting. This is the reverse sweep, let's try less power.
20230921 - 0037:   More power? 800 mVrms
20230921 - 0039:   try less sweep time
20230921 - 0040:   try way less - lik 100 mVrms
20230921 - 0042:   This looks like all zero :o gotta be, or am I crazy. One more run.
20230921 - 0043:   Oh my worldd - looks fantastic, but again, +1 state. before we didn't scan all the way through, maybe that's the secret? Let's only scan until 3.8 MHz
20230921 - 0044:   Hm - more in 0 and +1 even for a shorter scan.
20230921 - 0045:   the hell, this is the same, but we get such different results. Mainly in -1, but some of each. - maybe we're inducing something later on? Do we give it too much time to settle, during which we get some spin collisions? try less probeshut?
20230921 - 0046:   mmkay, similar. try a bit more, say to 3.9MHz
20230921 - 0047:   nope. try again.
20230921 - 0048:   but feels like more of -1 got flipped.
20230921 - 0049:   ye, similar. I do feel like the more 0 it appears, also more -1 appears. Gotta be spin changing collisions. Let's go to scan 2 - 4.5 in 100 ms
20230921 - 0050:   interesting, even more? but like before, maybe we need to wait one time before a reliable one appears. Which is strange imo
20230921 - 0051:   even more. I really think that during the settlement time of probeshut we get this another component. How do fight that? Try playing with probeshut time. But let's go to the one we had previuosly, the journal cover ones.
20230921 - 0052:   2 - 4.5 MHZ scan over 100 ms, @900 mVrms
20230921 - 0053:   still at 900 mVrms, just to check. One more, then we go to normal conditions
20230921 - 0055:   Hm, not as good as it was before, why not?
20230921 - 0056:   The hell? What's wrong now, everything should be the same. Let's lower the sweep amps
20230921 - 0058:   mm okay, start playing with the probeshut
20230921 - 0059:   Ughh, go to 250 mVrms
20230921 - 0061:   Ugh come onnnn - losing it?
20230921 - 0067:   A little sad. Not gonna lie
20230921 - 0069:   Maybe the laser shit? Should we turn it off and on again? Give it a little rest haha?
20230921 - 0070:   Try with 40ms probeshut
20230921 - 0071:   no difference
20230921 - 0072:   back to SG
20230921 - 0073:   crap. Go back to the other sweep I guess
20230921 - 0082:   here also is +1
20230921 - 0088:   200 ms probe shut, go to longer spinflip time
20230921 - 0092:   it's just so different results for the same settings.
20230921 - 0094:   the hellllll
20230921 - 0100:   240mVrms
20230921 - 0102:   Oh this is impossible
20230921 - 0105:   Kinda looks better, no?
20230921 - 0107:   Ugh man, I really wanna know if it's because of the ODT laser. I'll turn it off for a bit, to cool down or whatever, also the AOM. let's see
20230921 - 0108:   switched ODT off, running at 60 secs, to make sure nothing else changed
20230921 - 0109:   switched it off, at about 15:15
20230921 - 0111:   this looks normal, not gonna lie.
20230921 - 0135:   bit on the low side, but let's have a look in the ODT. we left it off for 45 mins
20230921 - 0136:   nope, def no difference
20230921 - 0139:   what a pile of bullshit, why doesn't it work anymore? What changed?
20230921 - 0143:   Of course. Kinda works. - I was thinking of restarting the RF amp as well
20230921 - 0144:   this is with now spinflipping - perhaps SG too stron? Or MT pull?
20230921 - 0145:   Try with 1V SG , amp back on
20230921 - 0148:   nothing. STOP BEING RANDOM
20230921 - 0151:   this is at SG = 2 V
20230921 - 0152:   try less spinpull
20230921 - 0155:   eh - good again, at lwoer spinpuill amplitude
20230921 - 0157:   Okay, here as well. Spliting it seems
20230921 - 0167:   beetje low
20230921 - 0169:   Upped the laser power. Try again in ODT
20230921 - 0176:   this looks promising? Should we go to OAH, see what we have?
20230921 - 0178:   Check at 0 tof, then go to OAH, just to see where we are, and if we see anything
20230921 - 0180:   Alright, interesting. Go to OAH, with both beams
20230921 - 0181:   Now we collect and wait until something good comes out of it. OAH from here on out
20230921 - 0182:   ! As per usual, the second OAH is way lamer.
20230921 - 0183:   too faint
20230921 - 0184:   mjah, similar.
20230921 - 0185:   so so faint
20230921 - 0186:   fainttt
20230921 - 0188:   no
20230921 - 0189:   eh, more like no, mainly the second one is shit. Also first one is nothing to write home about
20230921 - 0190:   no
20230921 - 0191:   ! yes maybe?
20230921 - 0192:   why is this one always so noisyy :o
20230921 - 0193:   no - let's try t odump all the power in one beam, see if that might help. But I don't think that's the issue.
20230921 - 0194:   Now dropped way more in the other one. let's see if I can tell the difference.
20230921 - 0195:   Yeah, okay, it's obvious all the power went into OAH-1 (that's the beam closest to the metal board)
20230921 - 0196:   let's do the reverse now.  Yeah I mean even in the interference you can mainly only see one component. Doesnt' look too promising.
20230921 - 0198:   okay, again obvious that we need more power in the other one. Interesting. So it is power. let's properly balance the powers, with a power meter. a
20230921 - 0199:   okay, both beams now should be at the same power, next run we'll also increase the t_light to 100us
20230921 - 0200:   looks empty, but both beams seems equally smooth, at least. Oh, no mot , try again lols
20230921 - 0203:   a faint little bastard. Second beam still a little bitch it seems
20230921 - 0204:   
20230921 - 0205:   ugh
20230921 - 0206:   Not sure if tlight does anything nice, man this is bullshit
20230921 - 0207:   honestly no big difference with tlight I think
20230921 - 0208:   tlight 250 here. Horrible. Can't make anything out of this
20230921 - 0209:   SG was on during imaging, but shouldn't do much I think, it;s 0 tof anyway. try again without
20230921 - 0210:   ! Meh, not bad, not good
20230921 - 0211:   Nice in the first, not so nice in the second
20230921 - 0212:   
20230921 - 0213:   mm not good. try no spinflip and spinpull
20230921 - 0214:   yeah, no spinflip is quite better. But not interesting
20230921 - 0216:   These are a bir better
20230921 - 0217:   !! Might be the best of the bunch, but no spinflipping yet here. Next ones
20230921 - 0218:   back to shit, first good but the other, meh. Also, out of focus. Gotta refocus this
20230921 - 0219:   eh :/
20230921 - 0221:   nah, sorry. Let's take a couple at no detuning, on resonance, but with all beams. Just for lols I guess
20230921 - 0222:   !! hah. interesting.
20230921 - 0223:   with tof
20230921 - 0224:   oh so sad actually - almost nothing here. Something weird is going on in the afteroons
20230921 - 0225:   meh, sad. goodnight now
20230925 - 0003:   t_light a bit high
20230925 - 0005:   okay all is good. Lemme try even less actually.
20230925 - 0027:   What the hell? Maybe the spinflipping params are not good?
20230925 - 0028:   Yes, better.
20230925 - 0032:   Less wait time seems to minimize the +1 state -> I kinda expected that. But it also makes the separation smaller. Also expected that
20230925 - 0034:   Go to more thold time
20230925 - 0036:   !!! Damn. Let's go straight to OAH. Let's first try the small frame, 200 pxs
20230925 - 0039:   Cool cool. Not super big, but let's go to OAH. Might actually be better still to use the full field image.
20230925 - 0042:   That's a big boy
20230925 - 0043:   Eh, not too good. No contrast it seems. Do we need more power?
20230925 - 0044:   Try also increasing t_light - feels almost the same
20230925 - 0045:   ! Maybe best so far?
20230925 - 0046:   !! OAH1 fairly clean actually, second one not so much - still seem to overlap though
20230925 - 0047:   Less good.
20230925 - 0048:   ! It moved? Quite a lot. Other than that, relatively good contrast in OAH1
20230925 - 0049:   !! Cool cool. This one might be worth analysing
20230925 - 0050:   !! Also good.
20230925 - 0051:   !! Interesting
20230925 - 0052:   try more t_light - this one not so good.
20230925 - 0053:   !!! Looks like best one so far, for sure
20230925 - 0054:   !! Good good
20230925 - 0055:   Less good
20230925 - 0056:   One thing that we forgot to so, oopsie, is to ramp up the B field in the direction of the probe light. Let's do that by ramping the ycom field.
20230925 - 0057:   !! With proper B field (I hope) For some reason it feels like the second beam has problems with unwrapping
20230925 - 0058:   less good
20230925 - 0061:   not as good. Losing it
20230925 - 0062:   Fainter. But we just replaced the LN, so maybe it needs some time.
20230925 - 0063:   Better, ish
20230925 - 0064:   ! Betterish also.
20230925 - 0068:   Maybe lost it, lost the lasers
20230925 - 0070:   OAH1 looks lovely, other one not so much
20230925 - 0071:   !!! Looking real good, just the second beam is a bit annoying it seems - on par with 53 (maybe different ideal foci?)
20230925 - 0072:   ! Not bad
20230925 - 0073:   Lovely
20230925 - 0075:   !! Lovely indeed.
20230925 - 0077:   Seems to be quite some motion around
20230925 - 0080:   !!
20230925 - 0081:   !
20230925 - 0085:   !!
20230925 - 0087:   !
20230925 - 0088:   ! Interesting
20230925 - 0092:   !! Nice one
20230925 - 0096:   eh
20230925 - 0097:   Eh eh
20230925 - 0099:   okay, not too bad
20230925 - 0102:   empty again.
20230925 - 0104:   OAH in MT vs RF time
20230925 - 0109:   How are the beams here clearer?
20230925 - 0115:   !!
20230925 - 0116:   !!
20230925 - 0119:   !!
20230925 - 0120:   ! eh
20230925 - 0121:   meh
20230925 - 0122:   Let's get a couple without spinflipping.
20230925 - 0124:   !! These are wihtout spinflipping - to see if there is some contrast in the two beams - I mean I guess it should be, right?
20230925 - 0125:   !! NO SF. Great but it looks like some unwrapping issues. What we should also check is how well the SG works with the B field ramp in the last stage. Feels like it might interfere with the SG
20230925 - 0126:   Try first with 1 ms of tof, to see if anything happens - then also 10, just in case. Want to see if we can tell different components apart.
20230925 - 0127:   1 ms tof, with spinflipping
20230925 - 0128:   nah of course nothing. 10 ms tof
20230925 - 0135:   Pretty good, actually. Seems like two components - I mean of course, the sequence is the same as before, just the ycomp field is all the way on.
20230925 - 0153:   Try without the ycomp
20230925 - 0158:   Maybe want more spinflipping - let's go change some spinflipping paramss
20230925 - 0160:   Eh but also, it's late. Let's go home, wrap up.
20230925 - 0165:   looks better. But like full on 3 components
20230925 - 0169:   ugh, faint
20230926 - 0013:   What the hell, so so stripy. And there's plenty of time to mix
20230926 - 0018:   No splitting, no SG. Odd, should work. Perhaps it's because I ramped up ycomp during the spinflipping stage? Let's see
20230926 - 0020:   Bitch. Let's go check that everything is as should be. Wait, maybe some splitting there? Let's try more tof.
20230926 - 0022:   Hmm, not good.
20230926 - 0023:   oii lekker. That's what we wanttttt, isnt' it. Ya boy
20230926 - 0024:   Oh nicee. I made the sweep faster, perhaps not as good as it was before?
20230926 - 0027:   Oh lekker man! This is what we wanttttt. try no spinflipping to make sure which is which - I mean this should work, right? For sure. And it's with y comp on.
20230926 - 0030:   Lekkerrrr. Try more spinpull time, to see if we can get sharper edges
20230926 - 0035:   yessss
20230926 - 0036:   try more spinflip time
20230926 - 0040:   more spinflipped
20230926 - 0042:   too much in 0
20230926 - 0045:   fuck it, this looks decent enough. OAH
20230926 - 0046:   !!! Uf this looks promising! Analyse this --- focus at -0.0077
20230926 - 0047:   !!
20230926 - 0048:   !!
20230926 - 0049:   !!!( ! dare I? ) This one might be actually
20230926 - 0050:   !!! Seems to be a bit shifted - keep it running here.
20230926 - 0051:   !!! Although it does seem like we still have the same intensity everywhere
20230926 - 0052:   !!! Man these ones might just all be interesting
20230926 - 0053:   !!! until I stop it, all above are !!!
20230926 - 0054:   !!
20230926 - 0055:   !!
20230926 - 0056:   !!  As a sanity check let's try no spinflipping - is that sanity check though?
20230926 - 0058:   NO SF
20230926 - 0059:   NO SF
20230926 - 0060:   NO SF
20230926 - 0061:   NO SF
20230926 - 0062:   NO SF
20230926 - 0063:   NO SF
20230926 - 0064:   NO SF
20230926 - 0065:   NO SF What the hell happens to the second image?
20230926 - 0066:   NO SF
20230926 - 0067:   NO SF
20230926 - 0068:   NO SF
20230926 - 0069:   NO SF
20230926 - 0070:   NO SF
20230926 - 0071:   NO SF
20230926 - 0072:   NO SF
20230926 - 0073:   NO SF gets worse and worse. But somehow, maybe I'm biased, there is a small difference.
20230926 - 0074:   SF
20230926 - 0075:   SF
20230926 - 0076:   SF
20230926 - 0077:   SF
20230926 - 0078:   !! NO SF - should allow for comparison
20230926 - 0079:   !! NO SF - also looks decent for comparison
20230926 - 0080:   NO SF
20230926 - 0081:   SF - second image not good enoughs -could go to 80ms spinflip, where much more gets flipped into 0. Then the contrast should be changed.
20230926 - 0082:   SF - next, go to 60 ms spinflipping -- all above with SF
20230926 - 0083:   Doesn't seem like there's much difference between the two.
20230926 - 0084:   Seems the same, both beams.
20230926 - 0085:   Let's try to have 1ms tof, to see if we can increase the width of the cloud. Might be nice.
20230926 - 0086:   !! I mean back to some motion?
20230926 - 0087:   Maybe worth running here for a bit, at 1ms tof, to see how well we do
20230926 - 0088:   worse
20230926 - 0089:   don't see any motion
20230926 - 0091:   quite shit
20230926 - 0102:   i mean there's no components at all
20230926 - 0104:   nothing to see here
20230926 - 0114:   better again. let's loop over tofs. to get an idea.
20230926 - 0154:   Almost no +1 state, but also the particle number itself feels a bit low, to be honest.
20230926 - 0155:   0 and -1. More 0 than -1.
20230926 - 0156:   less probeshut, seems like indeed less of domains. Also, way more of -1 now, whereas nothing changed regarding the spinflipping
20230927 - 0000:   sure
20230927 - 0001:   I have no clue where all these particles are from lol
20230927 - 0002:   kay. go to ODT
20230927 - 0003:   few more, then OAH
20230927 - 0009:   check what best RF2 time is
20230927 - 0014:   All those without spinflipping. I want to get a few nice shots today, to test the imaging method.
20230927 - 0015:   Go to OAH
20230927 - 0016:   kay, go to OAH - first try withtout the B field
20230927 - 0020:   from this one onwards - field on
20230927 - 0021:   !! hm, not bad.
20230927 - 0022:   !! Also not bad. seems like the field just helps the resolution, it increases it
20230927 - 0023:   Quite some unwrapping issues though
20230927 - 0024:   the second image is just way worse. How was it so good in MT?
20230927 - 0025:   !!
20230927 - 0026:   Back to no field (next one)
20230927 - 0027:   First one good, second one shit!
20230927 - 0028:   !! First one good again, second one, seems like not so much.
20230927 - 0029:   ! no B field. Ughm why are you being a little shit? Try all comps on to their nominal values
20230927 - 0030:   !! Interesting. Looks better but definetely a difference in amplitudes, I'd say
20230927 - 0031:   ! With these B fields, it does seem to work better. The imaging. The second image. Strange
20230927 - 0032:   !! Funky.
20230927 - 0033:   Try keeping the comps on, but only ramp the y ones - because this looks better, in terms of the other beam
20230927 - 0034:   !! Looks a bit better. It's with all comps on. But still, ycom ramped up to 10. So should be an overall field in y
20230927 - 0035:   First looksing great, Shit the second one, again
20230927 - 0036:   !!! Very lovely!
20230927 - 0037:   !!! Okay, this looks good. Let's try with some spinflipping now
20230927 - 0038:   These all with spinflipping
20230927 - 0040:   !!
20230927 - 0042:   !! Neat
20230927 - 0043:   !! Lovely
20230927 - 0044:   !!
20230927 - 0045:   !! First very nice, second less nice, but still decent
20230927 - 0046:   !! Nice!
20230927 - 0047:   !!
20230927 - 0048:   !! Mjah, half decent as well
20230927 - 0050:   Decent
20230927 - 0051:   !! Decent
20230927 - 0053:   !!! NO SF - correct b field, should be. GOOD - should allow me to make the analysis on those
20230927 - 0054:   !!! Good good
20230927 - 0055:   !!! These should be good enough to show the 5/3 factor.
20230927 - 0056:   !!! Nice again
20230927 - 0057:   !!! Amazing, keep it running here - get as much data as we can really.
20230927 - 0058:   Seems less good.
20230927 - 0059:   !!!  Yesss looking good!
20230927 - 0060:   !! Goodish
20230927 - 0061:   !!
20230927 - 0063:   !!!
20230927 - 0064:   !! - Gotta say that it feels like it's a little thicker, the first one
20230927 - 0065:   !! Interesting.
20230927 - 0066:   !!
20230927 - 0067:   !!
20230927 - 0068:   !!
20230927 - 0069:   Still got it. Check in MT again.
20230927 - 0075:   Left it at OAH

20231002 - 0095:   I guess try going to 140
20231002 - 0103:   Super small, of course.
20231002 - 0117:   Lol, forgot the powermeter in. Lolzie.
20231002 - 0118:   !!! Fuck yeah, looks promising, actually. Def OAH 1 more contrast. Keep it running
20231002 - 0130:   
20231002 - 0131:   Okay - try now without the B field ramp. here on out
20231002 - 0142:   Maybe go back to B field.
20231002 - 0143:   B
20231002 - 0162:   
20231002 - 0163:   with spinflip here somewhere - empty or faint
20231002 - 0166:   go to z mag field, next one!!
20231002 - 0168:   Lost lasers
20231002 - 0170:   Empty still, why? Try without the z field.
20231002 - 0174:   
20231002 - 0185:   Go to z field
20231002 - 0188:   looks like there's contrast.
20231002 - 0189:   Include the x field. It's very faint.
20231002 - 0190:   XZ field - Decent. But still, seems like there's a contrast
20231002 - 0193:   Okay. Let's just go try with spinflipping and the whole shabang
20231002 - 0194:   faintsss
20231002 - 0195:   
20231002 - 0196:   Eh something, but hard to say - it does seem like the second frame now has a higher contrast. Strange, or is it?
20231002 - 0198:   !! funky
20231002 - 0200:   super faint
20231002 - 0203:   No spinflip
20231002 - 0204:   Defienetly the contrast changes around!
20231002 - 0205:   Def the difference. Try more with spinflip.
20231002 - 0206:   Ugh faint, but kinda there.
20231002 - 0213:   too faint
20231003 - 0001:   Not too bad maybe? let's lower t_light
20231003 - 0019:   with spinpol and spinpull and the whole shenanigan - no different spins?
20231003 - 0020:   But this is at the same conditions as yesterday with the contrast
20231003 - 0021:   Maybe SG is not in the right direction either. Or we are just fully in 0 state, that would be something. Ohhh YOU FORGOT TO TURN ON THE MOT COILS YOU SILLY BOY
20231003 - 0023:   Ugh interesting, why on that side? Which one is -1? Compare with the previous shot - seems like the unshifted on, the zero state is the one in the middle. Try with more tof
20231003 - 0024:   Yeah, I guess it's clear which one get's shifted - zero stays. want tosee if anything changes without the B field ramp just before the imaging
20231003 - 0025:   Okay, it doesn't change that much with or without B field before. I'm just wondering why now the -1 state seems to be on the other side? Spinpull seems to be the same as before?
20231003 - 0026:   I mean clear separation, for sure, right? But why on this side all of a sudden - lemme check the spinpull. Seems fine. Let's try increase the zcomp coil current. Also, should check if x works as it should. The connections are poor there.
20231003 - 0027:   Even more separation, when increasing the z. try going the other way. I want to pull them apart
20231003 - 0055:   I guess it works. Let's try more in 0
20231003 - 0056:   But it doesn't quite seem like it separates well.
20231003 - 0061:   losing it a bit? Check the powers and nitrogen
20231003 - 0071:   casually back at nice number. Let it run
20231003 - 0101:   Ugh why is this so shit. This is no spinflipping or SG
20231003 - 0118:   Maybe laser powers dropped?
20231003 - 0131:   very nicee
20231004 - 0006:   representative
20231004 - 0007:   Empty? why
20231004 - 0008:   Here but super smol :(  What's upppp
20231004 - 0013:   60ms scan - 80 on cicero
20231004 - 0014:   60ms scan
20231004 - 0015:   65ms scan on AWG - Go to OAH
20231004 - 0016:   Nice. Let's go fast to OAH.
20231004 - 0017:   Keep it running until something useful pops up
20231004 - 0019:   Medium - seems like OHA1 stronger
20231004 - 0020:   ! Maybe. Worth checking - seems like OAH2 is funkily shifted?
20231004 - 0021:   Kay, funky. Try different spinflip parameters - less sweep time, see if that makes any difference. - next go to 60ms sweep time
20231004 - 0022:   60ms
20231004 - 0023:   60ms - go to 55ms
20231004 - 0024:   55ms
20231004 - 0025:   50ms. Next, go to 70ms. (All these at 290 mVrms and 4-2 MHz scan)
20231004 - 0026:   70ms
20231004 - 0027:   70ms. None of those is that good.
20231004 - 0031:   60ms
20231004 - 0038:   !
20231004 - 0042:   Hm. Let's try taking 5 images, one after another with 35 ms time inbetween - straight to dynamics, I say
20231004 - 0043:   Just flies out of the picture? Jesus.
20231004 - 0044:   This is crazy - try without the spinpull during the imaging.
20231004 - 0045:   Nice! No spinpull during the imaging, seems to stay in place - more or less. There is some movement in both
20231004 - 0047:   go to smaller frame
20231004 - 0048:   10 frames, 2ms
20231004 - 0049:   Try some spinpull with 2 ms resolution. Should get some motion, I guess.
20231004 - 0050:   !!! Analyse this
20231004 - 0051:   !! Ohhh funky, it's like SG in situ.
20231004 - 0052:   !!! AMAZING Ohhh same story, this is so cool. Clearly one is -1, the other zero state.
20231004 - 0053:   Pretty cool as well, but not as good contrast - try more shots, for longer
20231004 - 0054:   !! Great. Go to 25 shots
20231004 - 0055:   25 frames Loll just flies off. Let's hope we get a nice contrast one
20231004 - 0056:   !!! You can see it fly away, but no zero component. Would be amazing to also have the third component fly away in the other direction. Try inverting the sweep? Oh mannn this is like a BEC Shooter !
20231004 - 0057:   Too faint. Try again. Then goback to the OG sweep
20231004 - 0059:   !! So cool - keep it running - go to 275mVrms
20231004 - 0060:   275 mVrms
20231004 - 0063:   Good good, but something is going on with the background
20231004 - 0065:   Quite nice! Try higher amplitude
20231004 - 0066:   !! Nice
20231004 - 0067:   !! Man, all of those are super nice.
20231004 - 0068:   300 mVrms
20231004 - 0069:   weird background thing, try again - otherwise interesitng
20231004 - 0072:   320 mVrms- go to 280 mVrms
20231004 - 0073:   Very faint
20231004 - 0076:   !! Quite nice
20231004 - 0077:   !! Nice. Let's try even smaller frame. Also at 80ms sweep
20231004 - 0078:   It's in the frame. Let's take some nice images. This is still at 2 ms resolution. Also, go back to standard spinflip values
20231004 - 0079:   But nice though. But still at 2ms resolution. Go to 1ms resolution. Also, more images.
20231004 - 0081:   hm empty. Try again. Go back to 2ms resolution
20231004 - 0082:   Hm, something is off.
20231004 - 0084:   Still doesn't work? Maybe lasers?
20231004 - 0085:   yeah, lasers gone
20231004 - 0086:   Back to 1ms resolution - still at 100 px width
20231004 - 0087:   I think we get such a weird picture because the frame is too small? - but the condensate is there. GO back to 200
20231004 - 0088:   Go back to 200, next one
20231004 - 0089:   !! Nice. Invert the sweep.
20231004 - 0090:   Try decreasing the values a bit, maybe we're blasting too strongly. Go to 225 mVrms
20231004 - 0091:   Empty
20231004 - 0092:   Faint, but there, It really doesn't like this sweep direction.
20231004 - 0093:   !!! Oh funkyyyy seems like a significant 0 component
20231004 - 0095:   Interesting
20231004 - 0099:   gone?
20231006 - 0004:   Woah what is this
20231006 - 0005:   uff funky - interesting. even without the spinpull we still see this splitting. Check more with scanning and then go to OAH. Reproduce the splitting movies from last time - try to go both ways. But this is fabulous. Not sure which is which though. I'd say that the left one is 0 and the big one is -1
20231006 - 0006:   Oh how neat. Go straight to OAH - oh wait, try to get +1 as well. - invert spinflip scan
20231006 - 0007:   No spinflipping I think - all in -1. Go to 200 mVrms (from 290).
20231006 - 0008:   Woah. For sure all components. This is interesting, more +1 component than -1. Go to OAH
20231006 - 0009:   But not as nicely spinpulled
20231006 - 0010:   With TOF, so nothing visible.
20231006 - 0011:   Actially great shots of the dipole trap. Go to multi image.
20231006 - 0012:   !! Seems like no spinflipping almost - but great contrast
20231006 - 0013:   All -1 - UUUf it was set to 200 mVrms (can't be, right?) go to 200.
20231006 - 0015:   !!!
20231006 - 0016:   Bouncing? :o  - this is with SG
20231006 - 0018:   Back to the original sweep 290, 4 -> 2, 60ms (next one)
20231006 - 0019:   Where are the other components? Try with the spinpull - also, some squeezing going on .
20231006 - 0020:   Nice, but still no 0 or +1 component.
20231006 - 0021:   Fainter, but there seems to be the 0 component here. Funky
20231006 - 0022:   - 1 + 0
20231006 - 0027:   !!! Yesss, 1 and 0 are here. Great!! Good contrast.
20231006 - 0033:   Ineresting, with 0 comp
20231006 - 0036:   !! Funky. -1 and 0, seems almost like we're draggin something :o Funklyy
20231006 - 0038:   It seems like it's leaving a trace :o
20231006 - 0039:   !! Super funky, this trace is real
20231006 - 0041:   Funky !
20231006 - 0042:   Still no +1
20231006 - 0045:   Can't get the right species
20231006 - 0048:   For reference, all was refocused to -0.0033
20231009 - 0003:   hm
20231009 - 0007:   check the coils
20231009 - 0008:   hm, at no tof it's all good :o
20231009 - 0024:   Ugh what the hell is going on. I mean it doesn't look like it's empty. Let's try restarting the camera? It feels like there are some pulse issues. Try with condensates, maybe? Should give us more tof time to identify the issues, if it is camera trigger timing issue.
20231009 - 0027:   still doesn't work what the helll l lll l l l l l
20231009 - 0029:   I think the cooling doesn't work
20231012 - 0006:   All empty. Why
20231012 - 0009:   still empty - lasers got unlocked. but this should be with locked ones
20231012 - 0010:   oh the sequence is a bit messed up
20231012 - 0026:   Hm, without RF it seems to work
20231012 - 0032:   RF back to not working
20231012 - 0055:   
20231012 - 0056:   Why so small? Laser powers should be sufficient and the nitrogen is running
20231012 - 0064:   beetje small. Maybe try less repumper? Or recheck the MOT repumper power.
20231012 - 0069:   idk, maybe try with more zeeman repump?
20231013 - 0053:   Looks like all in -1
20231013 - 0054:   something is being flipped here, nice.
20231013 - 0055:   3 comps. But super small. Ugh, this is nothing in OAH, for sure. Why so small - could try to go with the BEC Shooter here, and just run until we see something
20231013 - 0057:   try less probeshut time. To not let the components stabilize or what should I say
20231013 - 0066:   Utter shit this particle number what the fuck
20231016 - 0007:   BCW
20231017 - 0003:   Ugh a bit lowww - but the laser powers are great, really. Shouldn't be a problem there.
20231017 - 0007:   1.3 mW Let's check at different repump powers.
20231017 - 0008:   1.3 mW
20231017 - 0009:   1.3 mW
20231017 - 0010:   1.3 mW

20231017 - 0028:   what the fuckkk
20231017 - 0032:   why so smalllll - try going through the MOT currents again.

20231017 - 0201:   What should I lower the zeeman power?  - raised it few runs ago  from 105 to 130
20231018 - 0003:   Noticing the similar initial drop in pnums. Also, this should be without nitrogen - or well there was a little in the begining,
20231018 - 0008:   Let it run for a while
20231018 - 0011:   Cold be dropping due to nitrogen

20231024 - 0310:   Alright, more reasonable
20231024 - 0321:   with BEC
20231024 - 0327:   Looks like a good amount of cooling
20231024 - 0329:   ODT!
20231024 - 0331:   Go to spinflip and spinpull and such - 290 at 4->2 @ 60ms
20231024 - 0332:   empty. Let it run for a bit
20231024 - 0333:   still empty.
20231024 - 0334:   Oh, the cooling curves are wrong.
20231024 - 0336:   Nice, it's here. Let's add some tof
20231024 - 0337:   Pretty big as well - might as well just go to OAH
20231024 - 0340:   Wasn't really tof, because laser was kept on. Now real tof
20231024 - 0346:   What's up here
20231024 - 0348:   Nice. Let's go to OAH
20231024 - 0350:   
20231024 - 0352:   Cool cool - let's go take a few images in sequence.
20231024 - 0354:   Empty. Waiting for Marc to fix the nitrogen
20231024 - 0360:   still emptyyy
20231024 - 0361:   Lets try without the first spinpull
20231024 - 0362:   Seems to be pulling the +1 away
20231024 - 0366:   Spreads out a bit too much, but not bad.
20231024 - 0369:   Not too good.
20231024 - 0371:   Empty, also. Try no spinflipping and no SG attempts
20231024 - 0374:   Just the condensate
20231024 - 0375:   Great difference in contrast between the two, for sure. It's all minus one, easy to tell, only OAH1
20231024 - 0378:   Oh this is sick
20231024 - 0380:   empty. Slowly wrap up, shall we?
20231024 - 0382:   Try some other script. Then call it.
20231024 - 0384:   !! All three components it seems!
20231024 - 0385:   too faint
20231024 - 0386:   Too much zero component, not enough +1. Still not big enoughhh
20231024 - 0387:   !!!
20231024 - 0391:   !!!
20231024 - 0394:   All gone it seems. Lets call it
20231030 - 0004:   testing RF
20231030 - 0008:   Copying an old 2.fits seems to work - but not ideal, not sure what the issue is. Also, no atoms at all.
20231030 - 0011:   last image, dark one is off. For some reason - not sure what the issue is.
20231030 - 0013:   Hmm, maybe one of the shutters is stuck?
20231030 - 0024:   Ugh come onnnn
20231030 - 0026:   at no cooling
20231030 - 0037:   whatttt
20231030 - 0041:   I don't get it. im going home
20231031 - 0136:   No rf again!
20231031 - 0152:   Let it run and compare to the temperature variations
20231031 - 0203:   Seems to oscillate wildly
20231031 - 0236:   Increased the laser powers a bit
20231101 - 0048:   No nitrogen here
20231101 - 0120:   Nitrogen on from here.
20231101 - 0144:   huh so fluctuaty
20231101 - 0158:   Seems like less fluctuations when we turn down nitrogen flow.
20231101 - 0160:   Keeping the flow steady now, check if particle number stabilizes
20231101 - 0171:   I mean the flow here is relatively steady, no big splurges of water vapour also - still a bit wild
20231101 - 0184:   Ugh, 320M to 160M in one run
20231101 - 0217:   I want to start tweaking the Zeeman beam a little, see if that makes it more stable. - start with B CW
20231101 - 0223:   Nope, try more, B CW
20231101 - 0226:   Doing nothing. Try B CCW
20231101 - 0230:   More B CCW
20231101 - 0239:   nah - try T, CW
20231101 - 0247:   If anyhting, this is wrong way. Try CCW
20231101 - 0249:   T too much CCW?
20231101 - 0273:   Turned off the oven here, let's see how it decays.
20231101 - 0276:   I mean this tells me nothing.
20231101 - 0279:   nitrogen off here.
20231101 - 0291:   seems empty
20231102 - 0000:   lasers low on power - 60ish mW. Also looks like the probe is low on power, huh?
20231102 - 0001:   Ugh. Low, but okay, no nitrogen. let it run for a bit
20231102 - 0002:   why empty? Should be no reason - shutter just open for no reason in between :o
20231102 - 0003:   Mot is there, so particles. Why empty? - something wrong on the server side maybe?
20231102 - 0004:   Ugh what?
20231102 - 0005:   RF works
20231102 - 0006:   what the helllll
20231102 - 0007:   out of nowhere :(
20231102 - 0008:   I mean at least some atoms - keep it running
20231102 - 0011:   Whyyyyyyyyyy
20231102 - 0012:   Nothing changed.
20231102 - 0014:   Don't know. try restarting everything
20231102 - 0015:   Empty. Try at 5s cooling
20231102 - 0016:   Okay, well particles here.
20231102 - 0017:   Yep
20231102 - 0019:   FIne, let's keep it running here, at 0 time of flight, 60 seconds RF cooling
20231102 - 0076:   START PTIMMIZING MIRROR TOP CW

20231102 - 0099:   t11

20231102 - 0102:   t10.5
20231102 - 0106:   too much fluctuation
20231102 - 0108:   t9
20231102 - 0109:   nice, but sure will  drop just because
20231102 - 0112:   
20231102 - 0113:   told you...
20231102 - 0115:   START OPT B MIRROR CW

20231102 - 0187:   just playing a little bit with the gears
20231102 - 0217:   Start a scan over RF cooling time. 1 - 50 secs
20231102 - 0229:   empty
20231102 - 0230:   empty
20231102 - 0232:   
20231102 - 0234:   Scan finished here. Decays to zero pretty rapidly
20231102 - 0235:   Back to 5s cooling and NITROGEN ON
20231102 - 0282:   Go to 60 secs
20231102 - 0284:   empty? This is with nitrogen, shouldn't be empty
20231102 - 0285:   Nah, something else must be wrong
20231102 - 0303:   Start the list here - scan different rf times
20231102 - 0309:   howw this is with increasing cooling time
20231102 - 0340:   at 37 seconds of cooling, we lose it
20231102 - 0344:   and its back, this is real
20231102 - 0345:   Empty. Again it loosk to have that weird pattern, like we're dropping the particles somehow.
20231102 - 0347:   Huh
20231103 - 0002:   empty at 60s
20231103 - 0005:   here at 5s
20231103 - 0011:   here at 35s
20231103 - 0013:   poor fit, so probably an understimate of the particle number
20231103 - 0014:   here at 37
20231103 - 0018:   and empty
20231103 - 0025:   back
20231103 - 0036:   gone.
20231103 - 0038:   no rf - empty. Peter was wrong
20231103 - 0043:   looks weird. Doens't quite look empty here, but also I suspect the pulses.
20231103 - 0048:   Problem in MT - switching off at ~40 secs
20231103 - 0066:   Camera kaput
20231103 - 0079:   Turned on the nitrogen flow
20231103 - 0105:   Cool cool. Let's check the laser power
20231103 - 0108:   So weird Increased the laser power from 110mW to 140mW (but also repumper from 1.2 to 1.5)
20231103 - 0109:   Super strange. try less repumper. This was at 1.5 mW, put it to about 1mW now.
20231103 - 0111:   crazy, it seems to hate the repumper.
20231103 - 0112:   Ugh
20231103 - 0118:   Hmm, higher power, more fluctuaty?
20231103 - 0129:   ik ga naar thuis.
20231103 - 0132:   fluctuatyy - now for real naar thuis
20231106 - 0000:   Let's start a few runs without nitrogen, see where we are.
20231106 - 0017:   turned the nitrogen on here.
20231106 - 0030:   Nitrogen slowly starting to run. Fluctuations so far seem failry normal.
20231106 - 0034:   Opened LN a bit more - wasn't flowing.
20231106 - 0040:   Now that'smore like it!! (jinxed it, didn't I)
20231106 - 0044:   Let's go through the RF2 cooling, and check how we are cooling down to condensation. Also check the efficiency.
20231106 - 0046:   Might not be a bad idea to keep it running a bit more at 60s with nitrogen. For the fluctuations and whatnot.
20231106 - 0061:   empty.
20231106 - 0062:   Well, lost the MOT altogether.
20231106 - 0065:   Knocking on condensation.
20231106 - 0066:   Lost it again?
20231106 - 0067:   MOT still there, but no cloud after cooling
20231106 - 0073:   Condensed at 20 secs of cooling using this curve.
20231106 - 0074:   Try again, scan from 12s to 20s of cooling. See where we ar condensing
20231106 - 0093:   No condensation, but kinda loosing it here.
20231106 - 0094:   Lostt it
20231106 - 0101:   TAU=-5 (start optimizing tau rf cooling curve)
20231106 - 0109:   from here on the efficency drops out
20231106 - 0111:   TAU=-6
20231106 - 0117:   
20231106 - 0118:   
20231106 - 0119:   
20231106 - 0120:   
20231106 - 0121:   
20231106 - 0122:   
20231106 - 0123:   
20231106 - 0124:   
20231106 - 0126:   efficenfy start to drop out
20231106 - 0127:   finished tau -6
20231106 - 0128:   seems like we're losing quite a lot immedatelly after 60 secs.
20231106 - 0129:   yees. Marc, can you take a few shots with cooling between 55 and 65 or so, to see how much we're loosing between thet wo curves.
20231106 - 0132:   start analyzing from 55 to 65 s (tau7)
20231106 - 0142:   does not look like we are specially losing particles in those seconds, the loss is lineal and the efficiency similar in evry second
20231106 - 0144:   TAU=-7
20231106 - 0145:   with tau 7 --> efficiency extremely lower
20231106 - 0147:   Alright cool cool, carry on
20231106 - 0153:   TAU=-4
20231106 - 0158:   BEC LOST
20231106 - 0161:   TAU=-5 again
20231106 - 0162:   efficiency seems lower than in the begining
20231106 - 0168:   fuck nitrogen was off... lets try TAU -4 again with n
20231106 - 0174:   i am losing the bec at the last seconds of cooling
20231106 - 0177:   TAU=3 (I was cooling to much time... start again:) )
20231106 - 0186:   TAU=4
20231106 - 0193:   TAU=5
20231106 - 0199:   Was about to shut it off, but then thiss
20231106 - 0200:   Shut off the oven here, let's see how quickly it runs out.
20231107 - 0001:   Start without nitrogen
20231107 - 0008:   Turned on nitrogen, slowly running now
20231107 - 0013:   nitrogen start running slowly. I should turn it on when the lab gets turned on, half an hour or more in advance
20231107 - 0035:   Nice, stable at ~300M. Check with RF2
20231107 - 0036:   Start a cooling curve, Marc's exponential
20231107 - 0053:   Soemthing off in the WG - try again, cooling list
20231107 - 0059:   I think we're cooling too quickly here.
20231107 - 0061:   Eh not sure if this is a condensate - try again with different curves, less steep initial stage of cooling.
20231107 - 0062:   The disgusting particles are back in the water.
20231107 - 0075:   This curves yields a higher efficieny
20231107 - 0076:   For some reason fitting with a bimodal gives me a higher particle number (the gaussian part) than only fitting with a gaussian curve. Interesting.
20231107 - 0081:   But here we should be already closer to condensed. try larger tau, and make it deeper.
20231107 - 0090:   Let's check efficiency at a particular temperature, aka at a particular frequency. Looking back, let's aim to start the condensing at 15 seconds, at the frequency of 2.75 MHz. Let's build the curve that takes us there at different taus.
20231107 - 0094:   This seems to be just before the condensation, all should be at around 2 uK (slightly above)
20231107 - 0116:   Kinda ran out of nitrogen, so not too reliable.
20231107 - 0123:   Good, so the shape of the curve doesn't seem to have too much of an effect on the final efficiency, it seems. Let's also check the time needed, keeping it at the what seems to be the max efficieny at tau = -5. Scanning through different rftimes, so durations to get to this temperature. from 5 seconds to 20 seconds, 2x at each time.
20231107 - 0155:   Looks like around 15-18 seconds gives best results.
20231107 - 0169:   ODT
20231107 - 0172:   ODT, SG splitting, works wonderfully it seems. Nice splitting
20231107 - 0183:   All very nice
20231107 - 0189:   Not spinflipping as well. Will have Marc research this tomorrow.
20231108 - 0032:   Let's use more tof, some of the previous plots are a bit on the limit.
20231108 - 0039:   Go to ODT, but run the same list -> let's see how the particle number in the condensate changes as a function of the transfer temperature
20231108 - 0040:   condensate in the ODT
20231108 - 0042:   about 11M condensed particles in the ODT, not too shabby
20231108 - 0044:   Seems more or less comaprable in terms of particle number. Keep in mind, the trapping frequencies are not quite correct.
20231108 - 0047:   Interesting - seems like it's even better and bigger when we transfer it with a higher temperature
20231108 - 0049:   Something funky, seems to be splitting a little bit already, although no field or spinfllipping
20231108 - 0055:   Damn, let's try going straight after the 60 secs? This is strange, but it seems like we get the largest condensates in the ODT when transfering at higher temperatures. I think the limit is somewhere at 4uK according to my predecessor's theses, but hm
20231108 - 0056:   Yeah, pretty much nothing, I mean something small but practically empty.
20231108 - 0059:   Alright, number raising
20231108 - 0074:   Looks like some weird motion. Hard to say where we are in terms of particle number, but it seems quite big
20231108 - 0076:   Looks like a platou with the cooling between 5 and 20 seconds of RF2 really, in terms of the particle number of the condensed atoms in the ODT. Strange, but fine. Let's keep it at 13.
20231108 - 0077:   Alrgiht, all -1 it seems, and SG really did some damage to the shape. We still have that weird field on - let's keep the tof at 13ms, to make sure the shapes are more or less okay.
20231108 - 0080:   Oh interesting. Way better, longer sweep. Looks like the first thing to check - playing around with the sweep time.
20231108 - 0084:

20231108 - 0163:   
20231108 - 0164:   Raise Ampl while ( 40 ms sweep, tof 13, probeshut 400, NO spinpull)
20231108 - 0166:   More tof it seems we need
20231108 - 0167:   Super strange, it seems like the spinpull is also spinflipping in some way?
20231108 - 0168:   0.2 V
20231108 - 0169:   0.3 V
20231108 - 0170:   0.4 V
20231108 - 0171:   0.5
20231108 - 0172:   0.6
20231108 - 0175:   we cannot diferentiate the components without trhe pull
20231108 - 0176:   500  mV ( 40 ms sweep, tof 13, probeshut 400, PULL yes)
20231108 - 0177:   600
20231108 - 0178:   700
20231108 - 0179:   800
20231108 - 0180:   900
20231108 - 0182:   290 mV 160 ms sweep
20231108 - 0183:   290 mV 180 ms sweep
20231108 - 0184:   500 mV 120 ms
20231108 - 0196:   Nicely three components, let's leave it here and repeat the BEC shooters in OAH
20231109 - 0000:   Alright, I guess we have it straight away in the odt haha. Let's still check at 60 secs though. But encouraging, we have SG splitting (although no +1 component.
20231109 - 0002:   Ohh GG
20231109 - 0007:   Go to ODT
20231109 - 0008:   Oh very nice. Try first without spinflipping. Also, might be good to check the laser powers that give me this. This is fabulous.
20231109 - 0016:   Not shabby
20231109 - 0017:   Try only spinflip, no spinpulling.
20231109 - 0018:   Interesting, some little shade on top, but hard to say. Maybe less tof?
20231109 - 0019:   Shades of all three comps.
20231109 - 0020:   For sure all three, but kinda streched and faint
20231109 - 0021:   Let's play with comp coils to compensate
20231109 - 0022:   first check the z comp coil. Now at -5V, next shot at -6
20231109 - 0023:   Could be in the right direction, yep!
20231109 - 0026:   Maybe try different spinflip params, seems like we have too much in +1. First try at -8 z comp. Then enable spinpull, to see if that makes a difference, and mixes things up in the ODT.
20231109 - 0027:   Many domains, as we're used to, of course.
20231109 - 0029:   TBH, doesn't seem to have much effect on it - the shift feels pretty random. Let's tr positive just to see what effect it has.
20231109 - 0031:   Okay, this does seem like a strong effect -> positive z_comp, shifts more in the horiontal direction. try -9 and -10. But also definetely this gradient is present.
20231109 - 0032:   Okay, more or less all in line. Nice. Let's apply some spinpull now
20231109 - 0041:   Try no spinpull, but large probeshut time
20231109 - 0044:   Hm, no nice separation.
20231109 - 0047:   Ugh not sure bro - turn the spinpull back on.
20231109 - 0051:   Very nice. Perhaps a bit too much in 0?
20231109 - 0052:   Delish - perhaps even a bit too much spinflipping, let's make it shorter. 120ms to 90 ms
20231109 - 0054:   Loosing it a bitt - and the position seems almost a bir random.
20231109 - 0055:   Still seems like too much 0. Should mainly be +1 and -1, ideally. Try 100ms and 400mVrms
20231109 - 0056:   okay, better? nah
20231109 - 0058:   try less time inbetween. Or give it more time?
20231109 - 0059:   Try even less, like 40 ms - after that, try more spinflip time.
20231109 - 0061:   Am I loosing it? It's getting smaller and smaller. Less probeshut doesn't seem to do much. Try more spinpull time initially.
20231109 - 0062:   lost the lasers possibly? yep
20231109 - 0063:   try with 100ms spinpull time
20231109 - 0065:   Looks like more into +1 with more time. Okay, so increasing spinflip time should give us the control
20231109 - 0067:   Yeah, great stuff. Let's go to OAH and BEC shooters and play with the time.
20231109 - 0068:   Delish! Try at 200px width, first single shot. Then go to multishots. Second beam a bit worse than before maybe?
20231109 - 0069:   Seems more or less focused. Ugh the second beam is shit isn't it. Need to fix that
20231109 - 0070:   Forgot to keep the laser on.
20231109 - 0071:   Gagh so bad. Let's keep it running and hope we get something useful. Keep the laser on now.
20231109 - 0072:   --- FILMS from here ---
20231109 - 0086:   Ooh nice
20231109 - 0087:   3 comps
20231109 - 0088:   !! try less cooling to only get -1 first
20231109 - 0090:   !! nice -1 part with the little condensate accumulating at the end, funkyy
20231109 - 0091:   !!!!
20231109 - 0092:   !!! Here we go
20231109 - 0093:   Very nice, but oah2 is kinda shit :/
20231109 - 0095:   Go to predominantely +1 spin component - spinflip for 200ms
20231109 - 0096:   OAH 1 very nice and decent, OAH 2 za en drek.
20231109 - 0097:   Next one with 200 ms
20231109 - 0108:   Let's analyse and make little movies of all the stuff to make investigation easier later on.
20231109 - 0109:   Ugh yeah it feels like I need to fix the OAH beams first.
20231109 - 0110:   --- FILMS to here ---
20231109 - 0111:   I wanna check if the poor image comes also from the small frame that we have. Let's take a single image, after we split it, say after 12ms or something
20231109 - 0113:   Nah still very shitty, also here - in OAH 2, OAH 1 perfect
20231109 - 0114:   Maybea  bit better. Try less cooling and see some -1 component
20231109 - 0115:   !!! Yess
20231109 - 0117:   Even with poor image in OHA 2 you can tell there's a difference in contrast
20231109 - 0120:   Nope. Let's go fix the beams
20231109 - 0121:   !! This could be goood example of +1 working
20231109 - 0122:   !!! Yessss!
20231109 - 0127:   !!! Good
20231109 - 0128:   !! Also pretty good. Might be worth analysing
20231109 - 0129:   Ugh at 60 seconds but in OAH, of course. But the interference is in one way only, pretty muhc. A surprise we get anything from the other interference :o Lige genuinely crazy.
20231109 - 0130:   after 60 secs in the MT - 0 tof. But both beams still give us something. Quite wild. Let's run it through cooling :o. 25 images
20231109 - 0131:   it'll take ages to analyse though
20231109 - 0132:   Not bad - again but a bit smaller, in case I'll want to analyse some stuff
20231109 - 0133:   !! Cooling in MT
20231109 - 0134:   yep, can see the cooling in effect
20231109 - 0139:   try empty
20231109 - 0141:   Better compared to what we had before I'd say. But how much better? Hard to say without the atoms. Let me run it for a bits
20231110 - 0004:   Cooling through transition videos
20231110 - 0005:   Right - let's go to ODT
20231110 - 0006:   Next one with the laser on
20231110 - 0008:   Go to BEC Shooters - Lovely. But it seems like the OAH1 is now worse - these are without the B field ramp.
20231110 - 0009:   Huh, OAH 1 is shit now. Will need to check overlap again maybe? Let's check in FFT how they look.
20231110 - 0011:   Now the second beam is worse.
20231110 - 0013:   Why so baddd, quite shit shots
20231110 - 0015:   Maybe too small? Should we check how many particles we have? But also, the background seems a bit shite
20231110 - 0017:   Kinda itneresting, but seems like we're loosing them through the shots
20231110 - 0018:   200 mills, could be better. Why so low? laser powers are fine, nitrogen is fine.
20231110 - 0019:   Check at lower t_light, this is at 100us. Seems like we drive some transitions that we don't want to be driving.
20231110 - 0020:   Yeah, checks out. So particle number is not an issue. Check at the end of the cooling with RF 2
20231110 - 0021:   I mean this is so big, surely. Let's check the overlap with the ODT
20231110 - 0022:   Check the overlap by leaving MT on (and tof) and laser on.
20231110 - 0024:   Yeah seems like everything goes into IR
20231110 - 0029:   Run the list of different RF2 times to see the efficiency of the transfer
20231110 - 0048:   To 60 - 80 seconds cooling, then ODT. We can see that around 17, 18 we get no thermal cloud, but we can't tell from this how many atoms we really kept in the trap. But the overlap at least seems to be there.
20231110 - 0049:   Check the depth of the cooling, and investigate the particle nubmer. At 0.1 V, empty - so too low.
20231110 - 0051:   We need some tof to see.
20231110 - 0053:   Hmm seems like we're spilling?
20231110 - 0054:   Stripey stripey
20231110 - 0061:   Oh definetely some thermal cloud here.
20231110 - 0076:   back to SG splitting. Try at no tof
20231110 - 0077:   with  5 ms tof here.
20231110 - 0078:   Oh lovely, so even in no tof we can reproduce the thing form the OAH of course lol
20231110 - 0079:   !! - let's also try to get the other spin component
20231110 - 0080:   !! BEC shooter in absorption! Lovely - but it's like a comet :o
20231110 - 0081:   2 ms a bit harder to see thank 5ms tof. Also ramp spinflip time to 250ms, to get the +1 component
20231110 - 0082:   Only -1 still? Go to 300ms sweep time
20231110 - 0083:   Hm, still only -1
20231110 - 0084:   Oh funky, it does seem like we have three parts, does it seem like the +1 is just too far away?
20231110 - 0085:   messed up - probeshut too low, let's be smart
20231110 - 0086:   a bit on the short side
20231110 - 0087:   go to 30 ms spinflip
20231110 - 0088:   nothing changes
20231110 - 0089:   same, no difference. Try no spinflip
20231110 - 0090:   What the hell, this is without spinflipping. Huh? So those are not different spin components?
20231110 - 0091:   Now this is without the first spinpull, so obviously we are somehow spinflipping there. - no such separation.
20231110 - 0092:   Try only the spinflip now.
20231110 - 0093:   Nothing when only spinflipping.
20231110 - 0095:   Nothing
20231110 - 0096:   So so strangee.
20231110 - 0101:   I don't get itttt
20231110 - 0103:   Just nothing, I don't get it. Let's try with the old SG
20231110 - 0105:   !!! Dudee
20231110 - 0106:   !!! Oh my word
20231110 - 0108:   Holly dude this is proper splitting. What the hell. No spinpull, well, the channel is on, but the MOT channel is disabled. Let's try with the channel on.
20231110 - 0109:   Ohh, but two components I guess
20231110 - 0111:   Ohhh sickkk
20231110 - 0120:   I mean not horrible.
20231110 - 0133:   lights on
20231110 - 0136:   what the fuckkk
20231110 - 0138:   yikess
20231110 - 0139:   so low?
20231110 - 0144:   Oh come on
20231110 - 0146:   Still too low
20231110 - 0158:   Just no I guess.
20231120 - 0001:   Of course. Welcome back Nejc
20231120 - 0002:   What on earth? MOT looks faint as well, but the laser powers seem fine
20231120 - 0003:   Nitrogen is running but let's wait a bit
20231120 - 0007:   Let's keep running it, also comp x was off, but doubt that could change this much?
20231120 - 0008:   Check at 5s cooling
20231120 - 0009:   Alright, perhaps compx does have an influence after all lol. Still een beetje klein, ngl
20231120 - 0011:   A bit shit though - missing like a factor of 2?
20231120 - 0015:   Alright uff was worried for a minute there
20231120 - 0017:   huh
20231120 - 0022:   Ugh seems to fluctuate around here, but not sure why this much lower?
20231120 - 0028:   Oh what the fuck man, come on.
20231120 - 0032:   I mean looking at it from a far it seems to oscillate around ~175M. Which is a bit low, not gonna lie.
20231120 - 0040:   Pump off
20231120 - 0042:   Low :( paly around with the alignment of the Zeeman? - but at 5s
20231120 - 0046:   B CW
20231120 - 0052:   B CW
20231120 - 0059:   B CW
20231120 - 0072:   B CW
20231120 - 0075:   Feels more or less the same
20231120 - 0076:   T CW
20231120 - 0083:   Wrong way
20231120 - 0084:   T CCW
20231120 - 0097:   Ugh what,  T CCW
20231120 - 0104:   Just loosing it. Hell
20231120 - 0105:   Centered it on the diaphragm, only slightly below. scanning towards the top and over - T CCW
20231120 - 0166:   go to 60
20231120 - 0167:   FUCK YOU
20231120 - 0178:   I hate this ..
20231120 - 0179:   Lower particle nubmer and a higher temperature :o
20231120 - 0180:   Repumper T CCW
20231120 - 0183:   T CW
20231120 - 0191:   Lasers unlocked.
20231120 - 0194:   T CCW
20231120 - 0202:   Hm, seems to go up. But still pretty low
20231120 - 0220:   B CW
20231120 - 0225:   B CCW
20231120 - 0234:   B CW
20231120 - 0243:   B CW
20231120 - 0247:   I will cry. Laser powers are good, nitrogen is running, the alignment seems good, cooling works. I don't get it. At all.
20231120 - 0311:   Nitogen ran out recently
20231121 - 0016:   Go to RF2
20231121 - 0022:   Let's spinflip - 200ms, 400mVrms
20231121 - 0024:   Ugh, not good. No spinflip seen
20231121 - 0025:   Why no splitting?
20231121 - 0026:   Okay, something going on.
20231121 - 0027:   Nice!
20231121 - 0032:   Very nice! But I want more in +1
20231121 - 0040:   Let's try with also return sweep - so both directions. We go 4-2-4, 100ms+100ms, at 500mVrms
20231121 - 0041:   Almost no difference. Try with longer sweep, 150+150ms. (Next one with 150ms sweep, then the sweep back is cut off short, after 50 ms).
20231121 - 0050:   Try one way sweep only, but long long time, like 450ms. This looks nice actually - funky, because we're doing a sweep 4-2, but in the 200ms allocated for the spinflip time, we could only get to like 3MHz here. Interesting.
20231121 - 0051:   Huh, poor. This is one way only
20231121 - 0052:   Doesn't seem to make much difference. Try less probeshut, maybe we're losing it there.
20231121 - 0054:   Ugh
20231121 - 0055:   Ugh this is just shit shit shit
20231121 - 0057:   OH very nice. You can tell we have less probeshut
20231121 - 0058:   Oh but lovely. We just can't get +1, ugh. Try sweeping the other way
20231121 - 0059:   !! But these are lovely, I think you can see the domain formation. Ohhh, smart smart, we can image through the probeshut!!!  Would be really cool cool to also have the +1
20231121 - 0060:   Reversing the sweep, not too good. I mean good image, but not good population control. Try lower power.
20231121 - 0061:   Interesting. This way seems to only give us -1 and +1. Go back to sweeping in the other direction
20231121 - 0062:   Yep, Sweeping this way does yield all three components. And I mean this looks pretty nice as well. Might want to make a list and run over different probeshut times? Would be epic if we get the +1 though. Try at different amplitudes
20231121 - 0063:   Oh funky. Quite a shift it seems.
20231121 - 0067:   Oof, loosing it? Scan 4-3, with 400mVrms
20231121 - 0072:   Try at 20ms sweep time
20231121 - 0075:   Even at such low time we still get normal splitting? Ugh, try even lower.
20231121 - 0077:   This now at 10ms sweep. Let it run, it seems like it needs to get adjuted? The antenna maybe?
20231121 - 0078:   Bit worse
20231121 - 0079:   Feels very unreliable
20231121 - 0083:   Empty - too much probe dosage?
20231121 - 0098:   Yeah, shit. Perhaps laser powers got lower? Nitrogen should be fine.
20231121 - 0108:   
20231121 - 0109:   Where are the atoms?
20231121 - 0166:   optimized laser powers - not helping :/
20231121 - 0213:   It's gotta be some drifts somewhere. I optimized the laser powers even
20231121 - 0216:   Ughhh sexyyy, bitchy MOT repumper
20231121 - 0217:   God damnit!
20231121 - 0223:   Oh man do I wanna do the BEC shooter or the probeshut list
20231121 - 0224:   Do the list
20231121 - 0235:   Gone?  - also fairly inconclusive
20231121 - 0236:   I think I lost the lasers. Let's wrap up.
20231121 - 0239:   Fuck no, we still have the atoms , somethine else then
20231122 - 0004:   don't get it - laser powers are massive - maybe MOT repumper too strong?
20231122 - 0006:   t_light is too high - we're driving the unwanted transitions
20231122 - 0008:   Better, but still a bit on the low side
20231122 - 0024:   Now I'm changing comp coils in the TOF - let's try do that before
20231122 - 0026:   Nice splitting.
20231122 - 0028:   A bit small
20231122 - 0030:   I guess we want to do it after the spinflipping really.
20231122 - 0031:   Played around with the SG a bit, let's see
20231122 - 0037:   No spinpulling, interesting, much more 0 component
20231122 - 0038:   spinflip time = 50 ms - make the splitting a bit stronger.
20231122 - 0040:   Lot's of 0 comp.
20231122 - 0041:   Pretty neat
20231122 - 0042:   Try even more spinflip time - there's no +1 component.
20231122 - 0043:   Lot's of 0 comp. Longer scan time
20231122 - 0044:   Ugh
20231122 - 0045:   Not as nicely spli
20231122 - 0046:   Try more spinflip time.
20231122 - 0048:   Some splitting but not huge.
20231122 - 0050:   Ohh interesting, shifts the other way? I just put SG in a separate channel, before the tof - to make sure the magnetic fields are on during the expansion
20231122 - 0054:   Lasers got unlocked
20231122 - 0055:   beetje small.
20231122 - 0058:   Not as good splitting as before. Is the trick in the spinpulling?
20231122 - 0059:   Try with spinpull
20231122 - 0060:   More splitting visible, interesting - run the list here, with different spin flipping times
20231122 - 0061:   Do the list, gotta be smart - modifying both the sweep time in cicero and in AWG
20231122 - 0062:   Spin populations at no spinflipping?
20231122 - 0072:   Laser issues
20231122 - 0082:   Like no effect on the spin components, and I went from 10 ms sweep to 1000ms sweep
20231122 - 0112:   No spinflipping (antenna off) but still multi component
20231122 - 0173:   Kinda aligned but compressed
20231123 - 0006:   waiting for the LN I hope
20231123 - 0036:   Just a faint splash
20231123 - 0037:   Looks like we're not cooling in the ODT. Indeed, the channel was off.
20231123 - 0038:   With spinflip, oh but what lovely. Check how the stripes match. Go to the finetune setting which aligns them.
20231123 - 0041:   Ugh. Still compressed, for sure.
20231123 - 0045:   Still compressed.
20231123 - 0047:   Tried keeping the comp coils unchanged. But seems to dissapear.
20231123 - 0064:   ! Oh so hot. But motion small, and let's ty to compensate now with the finetune.
20231123 - 0066:   Nice, but very stripy still
20231123 - 0067:   Oh interesting.
20231123 - 0068:   Try more tof - they are moving, but not by a lot
20231123 - 0069:   
20231123 - 0070:   More tof, more separated. Let's play around with the finetune
20231123 - 0071:   Too much finetune. Before the optimal was at 0.088
20231123 - 0072:   Still very stripy. Why is that? I thought it has to do with the quantization axis. But now we have it, and its still here.
20231123 - 0073:   Let's take a few more to be sure. But seems like we need more than that
20231123 - 0074:   I want to give it a little bit of X comp to lift it up.
20231123 - 0076:   Bit higher, but faint here, and more finetune it seems.
20231123 - 0081:   The direction seems good. But faint
20231123 - 0085:   Lost the lasers AGAIN
20231123 - 0087:   Try less spinflip.
20231123 - 0088:   All in -1 it seems, but here maybe the spinflip was not times properly. Try again.
20231123 - 0091:   No 0 comp, make it longer.
20231123 - 0092:   Oh accidentally set the time to 650 instead of 65 ms
20231123 - 0094:   Ugh, fainter. It seems that SG kinda messes it up.
20231123 - 0098:   Much much worse. But it does seem like we have the 0 and +1 here.
20231123 - 0104:   shit
20231123 - 0116:   So bad.
20231123 - 0123:   No spinflip, no SG. Looks small, low particle nubmer?
20231123 - 0128:   Yeah no particles. Let's check laser powers.
20231123 - 0138:   Alright - poorly coupled in, some drifts. The interesting thing is that both repumpers were off, and I was able to fix both of them by turning the single knob
20231123 - 0148:   empty
20231124 - 0050:   !! oh lovely
20231124 - 0051:   Three comps, but zero very large.
20231124 - 0055:   Get only two components, but nice splitting, spinpull seems to separate it nicely.
20231124 - 0056:   Alright, interesting. Can bring mot coils all the way to 0.1. Try starting the SG before the expansion - perhaps turning it on makes the curvature. That would be silly.
20231124 - 0057:   Better with shapes, but still some compression. Try more in advance?
20231124 - 0060:   Gotta enable the channels Nejc
20231124 - 0063:   Too violent?
20231124 - 0064:   Oh funky.
20231124 - 0067:   Wild. Not nice, very violent.
20231124 - 0068:   Maybe we lost laser powers? Or just atoms in general, let's check. Oh no, the finetune is strongly on.
20231124 - 0078:   Okay... - try negative xcomp, so shift it downwards. Possibly need more MOT current, this is at 0.05
20231124 - 0079:   Seems like only one component?
20231124 - 0080:   Yeah, no SG it seems. Oh I wanna try keeping the finetune on - no SG, also no spinflipping. - , see if the stripes dissapear if we make sure the quantization axis stays put.
20231124 - 0083:   Where's the second component?
20231124 - 0085:   No stripes? Ohh funky funky - try without the finetune now. Ohh I like this, this could be useful
20231124 - 0086:   Turn off finetune before probeshut - soo give it 400 ms to dance around
20231124 - 0087:   Hmm, no stripes, or maybe something happening at the edge. Try more probeshut?
20231124 - 0088:   Some stripes appearing. I hope increasing probeshut should increase that.
20231124 - 0089:   No stripes. Might be worth checking also before the ODT cooling
20231124 - 0090:   No stripes - or small onset at the edges. Try turning it off before cooling. Hm, it seems like we get it during tof?
20231124 - 0091:   !! Uf. Looks like solitons?
20231124 - 0092:   No stripes. Try with MOT SG splitting during the tof, but no spinflipping.Finetune coils off. It always seems tos tart on the right side. Something with the trap params?
20231124 - 0093:   Oh strangeee. Some stripes but not really - larger though. Again on the right side. So not the problem with the potential of the trap, which is good.
20231124 - 0094:   Where are the stripes now haha. Try with spinflipping now.
20231124 - 0095:   Stripes! So something to do with spin, gotta be the quantization axis. Also only one ocmponent? Try with finetune coils on during SG
20231124 - 0096:   !!! Oh woah. Woah Woah. I think you can see the components being pulled apart, but look at how clear the stripes are here. Try more TOF.Then try no MOT coils, so spinflip but keep the constant finetune field, no changes to the magnetic fields at all after spinglipping
20231124 - 0097:   shapes strangly similar, not a lot of compression. Try again the previous setup, to see if it was a coincidence.
20231124 - 0100:   Okay, so spinflipping, and keeping the constant B-field STILL yields stripes.
20231124 - 0101:   
20231124 - 0123:   Huh? Even with SG using MOT we see no shift? perhaps we should turn off FT coils fully? I mean this is with no spinflip, but that should just mean we're fully in -1 state.
20231124 - 0124:   Try with spinflip
20231124 - 0125:   Why no motion? Stripes are back, but no motion? Maybe probeshut too long and it all settles in 0? Ugh , Let's try changing both of these things (finetune to 0, probeshut to 100ms, no spinflipping).
20231124 - 0126:   Nothing.
20231124 - 0134:   with spinflipping - the stripes are back!
20231124 - 0135:   !! Oah. Yeah lovely, all three components visible, with 20ms time of flight they fly apart quite a lot. This is with MOT coils, so also still compressions.
20231124 - 0136:   
20231124 - 0138:   !! Oh very very nice - try slightly different spinflipping parameters.
20231124 - 0139:   !!! Oh my oh my - so it seems like they are on opposite sides.
20231124 - 0150:   !! Oh what the hell? Is this like, we turn the magnetic trap on again, to make sure the -1 are still trapped, but we tof the 0 atoms? :o
20231124 - 0152:   Uff gotta turn it off. But funky, think about this, what we could use it for.
20231124 - 0153:   
20231127 - 0000:   Just an image
20231127 - 0002:   try side imaging
20231127 - 0003:   Not fully hitting the sensor, but might be good enough? - let's collect some data at 60s with normal imaging, then compare - also, to help us determine the magnification factors etc
20231127 - 0004:   Waiting for LN to hit - turned it on here.
20231127 - 0038:   ffs the nitrogen just wasn't running
20231127 - 0044:   Nitrogen kicked in, let's make sure it's not too much
20231127 - 0049:   I mean nitrogen running but this is not the best ever - check laser powers
20231127 - 0081:   With side imaging - seems to work okayish, but not a great magnification factor. Might be tricky with small ODT clouds.
20231127 - 0083:   nice three components. Let's increase the probeshut to see if we get nicer domains.
20231127 - 0085:   Cool cool
20231127 - 0086:   SG Depth of 0.15 V gives the MOT current of about 1 amp. MOT X at 10V is 1.89 A, and is 1.0 A at 1.2 V Xcomp current. Try that. Finetune goes to zero in the probeshut time. Other comps staying at values where they were.
20231127 - 0094:   Ugh all over the place.
20231127 - 0117:   Hm, no big shift. I'd expect wayu more in the x diretion, but there's practically nothing.
20231127 - 0118:   Go to the max of compx, 10V -> 1.89 Amp
20231127 - 0119:   Try now with the max x comp. Doesn't seem to make lots of shift.
20231127 - 0127:   Why the fuck is the particle number so low?
20231127 - 0132:   No, also the other repumper is fine, at 25 mW, plentyy
20231127 - 0133:   Whyyy What's wrong. Maybe repumper power? Let's go check that as well. But if Zeeman rep is fine, the other one should be as well, imo
20231127 - 0134:   why the fuck is this so shit. Pardon my language but come on!
20231127 - 0135:   Just empty.
20231127 - 0137:   God damn
20231127 - 0138:   This doesn't seem to make a good separation
20231127 - 0146:   Splitting here visible. Why the fuckkkk isss theee particle numberrr shittttt
20231127 - 0147:   With finetune on the whole time. BUt some splitting but it shouldnt be, since the MOT was off.
20231127 - 0150:   What the fuck is going on, how are all the shots at the same settings so much different! This is so frustrating! Sorry, tof changed, so this is justified.
20231127 - 0152:   Let's set finetune to 0.3V, which corresponds to 1 A (for the SG) - all the comp coils, let's keep the way they are
20231127 - 0156:   Fuck youu this is so so shit
20231127 - 0157:   A bit better, but so randomly, I hate you
20231127 - 0163:   No splitting, but also no SG, so all good
20231127 - 0164:   !! Oh hellow hellow
20231127 - 0165:   ! Okay, somehow this kinda works. Still stripy. I want to perserve the shape, but want more separation. I guess I need to increase the x comp? (or perhaps decrease it to 0?)
20231127 - 0168:   Loosing it. Too much tof?
20231127 - 0169:   !! Opala. This is starting to look promising. If only we had three times as many particles. Or perhaps something that we're doing destroys a bunch of them, we should still be at ~200M at 60secs
20231127 - 0170:   Lovely. I think we need a larger tof to determine whether we still have compression or not, but for now it looks okay. try less SG MOT current
20231127 - 0171:   Ugh, this still at the old values of MOT current
20231127 - 0175:   mm okay
20231127 - 0177:   Okay, kinda works also at 0.4 V of power. Go to 0.15 V
20231127 - 0178:   Splitting, maybe there is some compression towards bottom-right? Keep in mind, this is also with the finetune coils. But I cannot just get it in the x direction. Perhaps if I set it to -10, so that we let the earth's magnetic field do the whole thing?
20231127 - 0180:   ! Interesting, without the finetune it seems to drift towards the opposite directions! So what does that mean? Could it be the comp Z ? Let's try turning COMP z and comp Y both off.
20231127 - 0181:   Huh. Shifts, but weirdly. Also compression? Kinda seems like there was no spinflipping
20231127 - 0185:   Weird. Try with finetune, but also try without spinpull, in case that's what pulls it apart. So weird, I'm slowly getting sick of all of this
20231127 - 0186:   Seems like nothing. Try more MOT
20231127 - 0194:   Seems like a whole bunch of nothingness
20231127 - 0197:   I think here we have the same thing, components pulled to the opposite sides. Maybe not.
20231127 - 0198:   Hm...
20231127 - 0199:   This is with y comp on, interesting (the axis along the probe light, should be).
20231127 - 0200:   Not at all actually. Why is it going this way?
20231127 - 0201:   Althoguh maybe maybe? Maybe it's going along the axis of probing, but then still, huh? Try next with z and no y
20231127 - 0202:   Ohh super funky. Is the y coil introducing the compression?
20231127 - 0203:   No compression :o Is y coil in anti-helmholtz haha ? Uhm what?
20231127 - 0204:   So let's try the SG splitting from before, and no y comp?
20231127 - 0205:   Shit, this looks quite epic.
20231127 - 0206:   mjah
20231127 - 0207:   Uhm, okay
20231127 - 0210:   Hard to tell if there's squeezing.
20231127 - 0213:   No spinpull. Funky.
20231127 - 0214:   ! Looks good, it seems like there are some shifting left right?
20231127 - 0215:   Seems like the spinpull is doing something we don't want.
20231127 - 0217:   No splitting
20231127 - 0218:   Alright, some splitting here, without the spinpull, but had to increase the MOT current to 3V, but also, unfortunatelly, some squeezing
20231127 - 0219:   I should slowly wrap up, it's pretty late.
20231127 - 0220:   Check at 60s then shut off.
20231127 - 0223:   
20231128 - 0033:   nothing going on - no spinseparation? - tried to gently lower the gradient curves and such, while first ramping up the finetune - Allard says that might be better?
20231128 - 0044:   Looks pretty nice? Pretty big, some shift, but no components - also previous was not shifted
20231128 - 0045:   Why are they all over the place?
20231128 - 0046:   No spin components - try with some spinpull before condensing
20231128 - 0053:   Perhaps the most obvious here, but definetely some squeezing
20231128 - 0056:   Maybe some pulling? But not convincing
20231128 - 0057:   Faint. Lower tof and include some y and z comps. See what's what
20231128 - 0062:   Alright, something here.
20231128 - 0065:   Doesn't seem like a good particle number
20231128 - 0078:   Ugh. This is at the settings from the nice one from yesterday, but not nice. Particle number too low?
20231128 - 0079:   ! Okay, looks similar to the thing from yesteray. Let it run until we see something nice :/
20231128 - 0080:   Nice shift. Let's go through a list maybe, different tofs.
20231128 - 0082:   Loops, but make less reps per tof. Hopefully it'll work with two reps
20231128 - 0089:   Ugh faint :/
20231128 - 0090:   Pretty pathetic. But we're probably loosing particles here already.
20231128 - 0092:   Slight motion
20231128 - 0115:   The fuck?
20231128 - 0118:   Ugh what is going on. Probe power weird?
20231128 - 0164:   No spinflip, no spinpull, keep the finetune on. All atoms should stay in -1 state, and they do!
20231128 - 0174:   Notes time: it seems that slowly ramping down the finetune current doesn't work. My belief is that when we ramp it down, it doesn't happen as fast as we think it does, and during the SG time we still end up wiht some bias field in z direction. That's why it moves so much.
20231128 - 0176:   Fucking stripes? Is it because we shut off finetune and the spins start to move freely too much? Likely ?
20231128 - 0188:   worth keeping in mind that here we also slowly ramp down the mot and gradient coils, rather than just shutting them off, like before
20231128 - 0195:   Alright, now let's try introducing some x bias field.
20231128 - 0196:   practiaclly didn't move. Try again with -10
20231128 - 0197:   Yeah I guess it moves a tiny bit. Try more MOT?
20231128 - 0198:   MOT curr to 1, no difference? Interesting. Let's bring the xcom back to 10
20231128 - 0199:   I mean slight up down, just enough to confirm that that is the direction we are messing around with, but that's about it. can't move it much further, perhaps we need to increase the tof. Now at 13, go to 20
20231128 - 0200:   It doesn't move? It's at the same location it seems. Is MOT doing anyhting? Surely right, it did with the finetune coils. OOh sorry, the next one will be at 20 ms
20231128 - 0201:   Expands, moves a bit, but also gets this weird pattern :/ Try same, but lower MOT current
20231129 - 0005:   This was at like      75 mW + 0.6 mW + 19 mW (mot repumper)
20231129 - 0006:   This is at like         125mW +     1 mW + 25 mW (mot repumper) - How is it the sammeeee haha
20231129 - 0049:   Oh don't give me hope
20231129 - 0056:   Alright, well okayish, not old glory, but works. Go to ODT and explore the trap, we don't need much to troubleshoot it
20231129 - 0059:   Good good, where we left it. Quite nice and big
20231129 - 0064:   Huh? Why slightly shifted, and stripy?
20231129 - 0066:   Hell? Weird shape - change xcomp to -10, next next change  SGdepth from 0.25 to 0.1
20231129 - 0067:   Also motion in the z direction, why is that?
20231129 - 0068:   But the motion in x is detectable, I'd say. The shape does look better at lower SG depth. Let's try disabling then finetune even earlier, before the hold time.
20231129 - 0069:   mmkay, x motion visible. With longer tof should be more obvious. We can try turning the coils on before we let it expand through, so that the atoms feel some force in the trap already ?
20231129 - 0070:   Cutting the finetune before the cooling doesn't seem to shift it.
20231129 - 0072:   There seems to be some minor motion present
20231129 - 0073:   I mean for sure some motion in the cloud in the z direction. Is this perhaps related to the ODT?
20231129 - 0074:   So try enabling the SG in the channel before (during the probeshut) - but only releasing the cloud in the tof, of course.
20231129 - 0075:   With MOT and Xcomp coming on before the tof. -> Oh what the hell, why is it shifted to the right? Huh?
20231129 - 0077:   Shit dude, shit. Try without the xcomp.
20231129 - 0079:   Even with xcomp off, still the same
20231130 - 0020:   study the conpensation coils control
20231130 - 0021:   x=-10 y=10 z=-10
20231130 - 0022:   x=10 y=-10 z=-10
20231130 - 0023:   x=-10 y=-10 z=10
20231130 - 0024:   x=-10 y=10 z=10
20231130 - 0025:   x=10 y=-10 z=10
20231130 - 0027:   x=10 y=10 z=-10
20231130 - 0042:   Buffer underrun?
20231201 - 0002:   Let's try disabling channels to see what's causing the error. My guess is on RF
20231201 - 0005:   Intersting - seems like the MOT loading is the issue - or the 20 extra seconds in the run. Try lowering that to9 seconds
20231201 - 0007:   Crashed, even with MOT loading at 1s. Try disabling the MOT loading, and prolong a different channel for a few seconds, to see if the problem is in timing or in the loading channel.
20231201 - 0008:   Yeah, that works.
20231201 - 0009:   Huh, so disabling any one channel seems to work. It doesn't like that many channels? What the hell?
20231201 - 0010:   Seems to workkk don't know why tho
20231201 - 0014:   I mean we have the mot, why no atoms?
20231201 - 0015:   Why is it emptyyyy
20231201 - 0016:   Ye ye, high voltage errors
20231201 - 0021:   Empty.
20231201 - 0023:   Even at 5 seconds RF cooling, still empty, Maybe coils messing up? Let's restart them
20231201 - 0027:   We're backkk - but low particle number, fml.
20231201 - 0029:   Not many particles though. Might be low laser powers?
20231204 - 0028:   Slightly lowered the repumper. Try increase it a bit.
20231204 - 0030:   repumper at 1.7. Seems to work better? Interesting, was my whole life a lie?
20231204 - 0032:   try more powerrr
20231204 - 0033:   Put the repumper to 2.5, next run
20231204 - 0034:   Not as good
20231204 - 0051:   repumper power at 2 mW
20231204 - 0101:   Whyy I don't get it then, what's your problem
20231204 - 0109:   Whyyyy, I don't get any of this bullshit
20231204 - 0110:   Don't care, go to ODT.
20231204 - 0118:   ughh soo badddd
20231204 - 0119:   Try no SG, no nothing, keep finetune on, just to see how much it moves on its own
20231204 - 0176:   empty in SG with spinflipping
20231204 - 0195:   Alright, within the 200px frame. Go to OAH and take 100 pics or something ,see the motion.
20231204 - 0196:   Single OAH shot - go to 20 shots, 2ms between shots. Then increase to like 100 ms between shots
20231204 - 0197:   Need to keep the ODT on of course
20231204 - 0199:   This with 2 ms inbetween shots.
20231204 - 0200:   OOohhh -- massive swinging. Seems to have some sort of little dots, little axial mode. Try at 50 ms between shots, should show us more.
20231204 - 0201:   Alright, go to 100 images with 10 ms between the shots. Careful with analysis.
20231204 - 0202:   !!! ANALYSE this! Amazing, big big motion in the ODT. Not good. Not good at all. Shouldn't be anything, let's be honest.
20231204 - 0203:   !! Oh lovely lovely - with MOT and finetune, in OAH, can see the motion very nicely indeed. Lose it here after frame 8 or something. So go to 2 ms between the shots, and take a bunch of experimental data. OAH2 nicely less bright
20231204 - 0204:   !! Oh dude lovely, pretty good contrast as well, in both beams. What is going on, I'm going home late tonight, aren't I. With 2 ms between shots, we can definetely determine the force and acceleration. We can run the list with different MOT currents and finetune values.
20231204 - 0205:   !!! Only -1, why though? try without finetune currents. But super nice motion. Oh super nice contrast though.
20231204 - 0206:   !! Hm, without finetune it goes towards right? Funkyy - should still be -1
20231204 - 0207:   !!
20231204 - 0208:   ! Lovely! - no spinpull, just MOT and should be no finetune, so huh? Why motion in -z then? And why no spin components? Try more probeshut, this now at 40
20231204 - 0209:   !! Goes the other way? Huh? Is this all +1?
20231204 - 0210:   ! Def goes the other way - was the only difference the probeshut time? Go to 200 then
20231204 - 0211:   Ugh, try 40 again - It does seem like it's draggin something/ I mean it kinda checks out if these are all +1 - the contrast in the first beam is way worse. Oh I like it.  Ugh but no y field
20231204 - 0212:   !! Alright, moving to the left again, and the contrast is bigger. Try 100 ms probeshut. Oh man it workssss but why can't we show the spin splitting.
20231204 - 0213:   !! A bit too much, but still this dragging. So funky. Try 60ms
20231204 - 0214:   Goes left -> -1 . Try 80ms
20231204 - 0215:   Left - at 60ms probeshut. Go to 80 ms. But great contrast.
20231204 - 0216:   !! Still to left.
20231204 - 0217:   !! Still left - try 95
20231204 - 0218:   !! Oh interesting - it's stableish, but then it goes towards the right, so maybe just a bit too much probeshut -> So probeshut determines the spin population. Funky. Try at 93
20231204 - 0219:   !! Okay so 93 is still -1. alright, let's check 94 then.
20231204 - 0220:   !! Hmm, it just moves slowly, but still moves. So it's like it's a different quantization axis. Try including some xcomp bias field in the SG (in situ still)
20231204 - 0221:   (with xcomp) And it just seems like it's draggy. Oh so interesting. SHould def make an animation.
20231204 - 0222:   (with xcomp). So funky. Go to probeshut 120.
20231204 - 0223:   !! Try keeping the finetune on until the very end, until the imaging. Then turn it off.
20231204 - 0224:   Intersting - different I think still in the +1 state, but moves way less - keeping the finetune on longer. Try 200 ms probeshut
20231204 - 0225:   Get's masively stretched, but still motion to the right - try more MOT current - 0.5 to 3
20231204 - 0226:   It does seem quite stripy tho - still flies away.
20231204 - 0229:   I turn on the MOT a step before, and it just fucks it up. EMpty.
20231204 - 0230:   Again this bullshit. MOT only doesn't mess it up if I turn it on at the tof channel. Maybe it turns on already before, and it really shifts the whole shabang.
20231204 - 0231:   !! With spinpull and weak MOT. Try no spinflipping, and as a function of MOT and finetune now. But also ,this is without any bias field, or at least it should be. Try first disabling the finetune a step earlier.
20231204 - 0232:   !!! What the hell? All conditions the same, but now it's going the opposite way? Ugh. Try these settings with 150 ms probeshut. See if that makes it go the other way?
20231204 - 0234:   Okay, goes right and it stretches. As expected with longer probeshut.
20231204 - 0236:   Try without spinflip. Should be just going to the left then, right?
20231204 - 0237:   It's the same thinggg, why does hold time determine the spin, and not spinflipping? Try setting it to 0, lol
20231204 - 0238:   Okay, so -0 probeshut doesnt quite work
20231204 - 0240:   !!! Great contrast, but same spin specie, -1? As expected, yeah - can't get nice spli splitting.
20231204 - 0241:   !! Mjah, goes as expected, given this probeshut. But great contrast again. Try keeping the finetune on the entire time. See what happens then. Tris is with spinflipping.
20231204 - 0242:   Get's more stretched actually. But should be the sameeeeeeee. But it seems like it's first going left, then right?
20231204 - 0243:   Stretches it. Not good contrast tho
20231205 - 0016:   Forgot to open up the camera, lol
20231205 - 0017:   Ugh
20231205 - 0018:   This is the actual one. Ugh
20231205 - 0020:   Nitrogen still settling
20231205 - 0026:   Comeon nitrogen
20231205 - 0031:   Seems to rise a bit?
20231205 - 0039:   Nice. That's more like it, it only took us 40 runs, and it's 3pm, but sure, why not. Go straight to ODT, and what do we want to check?
20231205 - 0042:   !! Oh lovely, we go. Try probeshut at 800, this is at 30 or something. Gosh very nice. Also the second beam is pretty clear. And i think the contrast is also at that expected value. Try sending it the other way.
20231205 - 0043:   !! So good. Good for -1 contrast analysis - some parts are unwrapped wrongly, but you can for sure tell.
20231205 - 0044:   !! WOAH IT COMES BACK AS WELL? Try more frames to see where this is going. Uffff, but at 800 ms all of them are going towards the left. We'd expect the right, no? Unless it's related to the initial oscillation of the cloud. It's gotta be. So no spin sensitivity.
20231205 - 0045:   !!! With lower MOT current seems to oscillate less wildly. But still oscillates? We need to check the one without any perturbations again.
20231205 - 0046:   !! 100 frames Less depth, more frames.
20231205 - 0047:   !! 100 frames - it oscialltes, but it only goes to the center and back, and not also to the other side. Try without the spinflipping and any B-fields (only z comp).
20231205 - 0048:   !! 100 frames - Motion, but different? I don't get ittt
20231205 - 0049:   !! 100 frames - Different again? Whyy
20231205 - 0050:   !! 100 frames -
20231205 - 0051:   !! 100 frames - There was no spinflipping this entire time
20231205 - 0052:   !! 100 frames -- Ooh super funky dude.
20231205 - 0053:   !! 100 frames - probeshut at 600, jumpy. With spinflipping?
20231205 - 0054:   !! 20 frames - With spinflippping, but no effect - why nottt
20231205 - 0055:   !! 20 frames - Funky nontheless, with spinflipping - not sure if we are actually doing any spinflipping - go to 55ms spinflip time
20231205 - 0056:   !! 20 frames -
20231205 - 0057:   !! 20 frames - I mean something for sure happens, something interesting. Go to spinflip time of 45, and back to 50 frames
20231205 - 0058:   !! 50 frames.  Seems like we just spread it across the ODT. Funkyy
20231205 - 0059:   !! 50 frames - Oh seems like we are pulling something tho, and something remains?
20231205 - 0060:   !! 50 frames
20231205 - 0061:   50 frames! Empty though. Turning MOT on before the actual channel just messes it up. Fuck, don't get itttt, it should be set to 0
20231205 - 0062:   50 frames
20231205 - 0063:   50 frames
20231205 - 0064:   50 frames. Very nice, but it just causes it to oscillate - not really SG separation I fear.
20231205 - 0065:   Slow oscillations. Nothing special. I tried to turn on the MOT about 10 frames into the imaging.
20231205 - 0066:   This is with 5ms tof, when the MOT is already on. So should be 5ms along compared to the previous ones. Let's try with 15ms tof.
20231205 - 0067:   !! Yeah, id say this is as expected. So turning the MOT on is what creates the motion, or potentiates it. Try imaging through the transition, without the cooling, and with short probeshut
20231205 - 0068:   Alright, this just seems to work? Let's take 100 images with 10 ms resolution. Like yesterday
20231205 - 0069:   !! Doesn't seem to be that much motion?
20231205 - 0070:   !! 100 frames - But, there seems to be no motion? Try with some hold time.
20231205 - 0071:   !! 50 frames only, sitll 10 ms between the shots. Still no motion? Try now with cooling
20231205 - 0072:   No motion? huh?
20231205 - 0073:   With cooling, should be similar to the 202 from yesterday - the main one where we investigated the motion inside the trap. But is it comparable? We'll have to check in the video postproduction
20231205 - 0075:   No SG, and this seems to have a much bigger motion than the previous once. This one is with spinflipping tho.
20231205 - 0076:   50 frames
20231205 - 0077:   Empty
20231205 - 0078:   Empty.
20231205 - 0081:   Alright, run a megalist of different spinflipping times - also put probeshut to 120 ms, just for fun because fuck the probeshut, that's why
20231205 - 0082:   0 ms scan
20231205 - 0083:   0
20231205 - 0084:   10

20231205 - 0096:   140
20231205 - 0097:   150 It's all the sameee :(
20231205 - 0098:   160
20231205 - 0099:   170
20231205 - 0100:   190 Can't reproduce the BEC shooter :( Is spinflipping working normally?
20231205 - 0101:   200 With MOT coils on before the tof and before the imaging. Ugh, try looping over spinflip amplitude.
20231205 - 0102:   50mV amplitude, all at 45 ms scan
20231205 - 0103:   72.5
20231205 - 0104:   95

20231205 - 0113:   320
20231205 - 0114:   342.5 Nothing.
20231205 - 0115:   365 No splitting at all, anywhere - last thing - loop over SG amplitudes. 0 to 3 V, steps of 0.2
20231205 - 0120:   Forgot to run the list, IDIOT
20231205 - 0127:   NOthing is happeningggg Whyyyy
20231206 - 0024:   Nice, we have it. Let's move it around a bit. With, and without spinpull.
20231206 - 0028:   !! 20 frames from here on out. Nicely moves to the left! As expected. Try now everything the same, but with spinpull on as well.
20231206 - 0029:   !! Still going to the left! So it is the probeshut that affects it. Try at 400, then 600, etc etc. Seems like it is that what affects it.
20231206 - 0030:   Still to the left? Hm
20231206 - 0031:   Still to the left, I don't get it. I am changing the finetune coils slightly differently.
20231206 - 0032:   !! Still to the left, but kinda interestingly, seems to squash a bit. How is it different, still, compared to what we had before. Try with the finetune analogue group changed
20231206 - 0033:   !! Less motion, but it get's more stretched.
20231206 - 0034:   !! Yeah, goes to the right. So with finetune on, moves to the right. Ugh, but those should still be -1 atoms. Or not? Try less probeshut. Or could it just be how long until the field comes on and pushes it? So two options I guess
20231206 - 0035:   !! Yeah, goes left. So what's a good way of determining which of the two is the real reason? Hm
20231206 - 0036:   To the right. WIth the finetune field on the entire time.
20231206 - 0037:   !! Nice shots, to the left. Try spinflipping to get it to the right. Spinflip time to 95ms, should be enough.
20231206 - 0038:   Still to the left? Why does nothing match what I saw yestreday?
20231206 - 0039:   !! Goes right - ugh but here I changed the probeshut, increased it to 200ms - try the same but with less cooling time. so 95ms to 45ms.
20231206 - 0040:   Still goes ot the right. I don't understanddddddddddddddd
20231206 - 0041:   Ah fuck off.
20231206 - 0042:   Yeah, lower probeshut -> goes the other way. But whyyy? Something with finetune I suspect? God damnit
20231206 - 0043:   To the left.
20231206 - 0044:   Goes ot the left. Try more probeshut. But I don't get this.
20231206 - 0045:   To the right. Contrast mathces. No idea. Try without any field during the cooling.
20231206 - 0046:   to the right
20231206 - 0047:   odd
20231206 - 0052:   Lasers kaput. Had to relock
20231206 - 0055:   Gets stretched. Try the edge parameters, probeshut 93, spinflip time 75ms, high MOT field.
20231206 - 0057:   !! Very nice, quite cool. In theory changing the spinflip parameters should send it to the other side, right. But lemme guess, it's not gonna happen.
20231206 - 0059:   Why still this way? I don't get this at all. I hate this lab and these things being different every single time.Keep the fine tune on until the very end. Now I turned it off during the hold time. Now just keep in on.
20231206 - 0060:   Okay, this sends it right. Try with less spinflip. This might be the solution? Just turn off the digital channel. Jasper was right again, SHOCKER
20231206 - 0061:   Empty, of course. Hopefully we just lost the lasers (as in got unlocked, not actualy lost them, please please not actually anything serious)
20231206 - 0062:   Atoms here, but still going towards the right. Whyyyyyyy. Try less spinflipping
20231206 - 0063:   Empty again.
20231206 - 0064:   Still empty. What's up buddy?
20231206 - 0065:   Empty. Go check the lasers.
20231206 - 0066:   !! There it is, and it goes to the left !!  Which is what we want. And by increasing the spinflip time we should be able to get it to go right?
20231206 - 0067:   Still to the left. Ugh
20231206 - 0068:   !! 115ms spinflipping, goes to the right. Yey, nice! But it seems like the spintime threshold for the atoms is elsewhere. And it also seems like we're stretchting when moving outwards.Try less MOT current? 

Let's take a few to make sure we get a nice sequence with many nice condensates, where we can compare the contrast.
20231206 - 0069:   Just strethces, the MOT current too low. Hmm. But yeah, feels like for sure better contrast in the second beam. Lovely. I want to try turn off the laser, just before the imaging. So we see perhaps some tof in free space? Densities should go down pretty quickly.
20231206 - 0070:   Nah, dissapears in the second, third frame. Can't make much of this.
20231206 - 0071:   Still this deformation effect, it seems. Perhaps introduce some bias field to shift the MOT zero? - try next at nice 3 comp configuration, according to the previous expreimtns - 65ms spinflip
20231206 - 0072:   Keep a strong bias field on, also do less spinflip so that we have -1 component
20231206 - 0074:   Why righttt? Goddd. Finetune perhaps shifts the MOT gradient too far and we get this?
20231206 - 0076:   !!Yeah, this boy goes left, still squeezing. Let's take a list with fintunde dependence. And then we can calculate how much we're shifting it. Ohh this could be interesting! Keep the spinflip time at 15ms as well. To make sure we're only dealing with -1. Or mostly.
20231206 - 0077:   !! Oh shit. Alright, let's run the list, different finetune currents
20231206 - 0078:   !!
20231207 - 0032:   But like this is from the trap? Oh but the images are way too close together, time between shots is way too small. Try increaseing to 20, and we should see it I guess
20231207 - 0035:   Doesn't seem to have any motion? Oh come on, what the heck
20231207 - 0039:   Go to time between shots to 20ms
20231207 - 0040:   Some motion, but it definetely seems less? What's the difference to the other one? Did we spinflip last time? There is some bias finetune field on right now. LEt's try to suddenly turn off the MOT and gradient (until now we were slowly ramping it down)
20231207 - 0043:   Massive pull to the right, looks like finetune effect. Why? Massive MOT though. Could try with less MOT or with less spinflip, because it looks like we're in the +1. Try no spinflipping
20231207 - 0044:   Oh actually not that massive of a pull, we just have a large time between shots. Try bringing it back to 2ms, or maybe 5ms.
20231207 - 0045:   How and why does it go to the right againnnn UGGHHH
20231207 - 0046:   It's gotta be the probeshut effect. Try again with less probeshut. Still goes to the right, but it doesn't come back.
20231207 - 0047:   OH MY GODDDDD IM AN IDIOTTTTT . WHY WAS THE SPINFLIP SIGNAL AT THE PROBESHUT PART UGHH HWHATHs dKLJFAHDlk:jfh
20231207 - 0049:   Goes left. we disabled the finetune a step later, so just before the TOF and imaging. try more spinflipping now.
20231207 - 0050:   Empty. Maybe lost the lasers? Doubt spinflipping could get us these problems
20231207 - 0052:   Go check the lasers
20231207 - 0053:   LIST: 10ms Schedule a little spinflip time run. Also, bring probeshut to 400, so we get nice domains, hopefully.
20231207 - 0054:   Also, SG depth to 2 V from next next one out
20231207 - 0055:   Shit, this looks pretty good.
20231207 - 0058:   To the left - but it seems like it's expanding as well. Not what we're used to.
20231207 - 0060:   55 ms - Hmm, interesting.
20231207 - 0062:   67 ms To the right, but it seems like it's kinda dragging some 0 component with it as well. Interesting.
20231207 - 0065:   86 ms spinflip time To the right - +1?
20231207 - 0171:   messed up.  lasers I think
20231207 - 0174:   Yep, lost the lasers.
20231207 - 0177:   200 ms spinflipping.
20231207 - 0181:   Try with 55ms sweep time
20231207 - 0182:   55 ms spinflip, 2 ms time between the shots as well - seems quite faint :/
20231207 - 0183:   Try no spinpull. Ehh
20231207 - 0184:   Ugh it's shittt - take a few -1's, then a few +1's. And then we can analyse to see the contrast. - let's go 10 - 10
20231207 - 0185:   Cool cool, 9 more, then to +1. Let's just use up the nitrogen
20231207 - 0186:   Could be better.
20231207 - 0194:   Eh, not too good of shots, I'm afraid
20231207 - 0199:   Go to +1
20231207 - 0200:   +1 starts here
20231207 - 0202:   I feel like the particle number might be a bit shit here, so let's tomorrow repeat this, at more optimal conditions, I hope. Then recirc tomorrow also over the weekend. Just in case.
20231207 - 0205:   But the contrast seems thereee
20231208 - 0004:   Still no particles. Lol laser is off
20231208 - 0006:   got it
20231208 - 0009:   Set sweep time to 115ms
20231208 - 0010:   FAint, but +1
20231208 - 0013:   Nice. Looks promising!!
20231208 - 0015:   Sweep time to 5 ms
20231208 - 0016:   Yeh, contrast is there. For sure.
20231208 - 0026:   !!Oh amazing! But why is there no zero component? Try with B-field oriented differently.
20231208 - 0029:   Fuckk. Even with the field not in y-direction we see the contrast. Not happy about this.
20231208 - 0030:   Definetely different contrast. We woulnd't necessarily expect that.
20231208 - 0041:   Much more probe shut. Empty. It seems. Maybe lost the lasers?
20231208 - 0046:   No MOT field from here on out
20231208 - 0048:   +1 No MOT, with BIAS in y
20231208 - 0049:   +1 No MOT, with BIAS in y
20231208 - 0050:   +1 No MOT, with BIAS in y
20231208 - 0051:   +1 No MOT, with BIAS in y
20231208 - 0052:   +1 No MOT, with BIAS in y
20231208 - 0053:   +1 No MOT, with BIAS in y
20231208 - 0054:   +1 No MOT, with BIAS in y
20231208 - 0058:   Try no MOT field, no bias fields.
20231208 - 0063:   ------- analysis from here ---- Should be +1. Go to 95 ms spinflip time.
20231208 - 0064:   +1, no MOT, no bias. Looks good. Analysis from here. Take 5 with 95ms spinflip, 5 without
20231208 - 0065:   +1, no MOT, no bias
20231208 - 0066:   +1, no MOT, no bias
20231208 - 0067:   +1, no MOT, no bias
20231208 - 0068:   +1, no MOT, no bias
20231208 - 0069:   +1, no MOT, no bias - Change the spinflip time to 15ms (starting next one)
20231208 - 0070:   -1, no MOT, no bias
20231208 - 0071:   -1, no MOT, no bias
20231208 - 0072:   -1, no MOT, no bias
20231208 - 0073:   -1, no MOT, no bias
20231208 - 0074:   -1, no MOT, no bias
20231208 - 0075:   -1, no MOT, no bias
20231208 - 0076:   -1, no MOT, no bias
20231208 - 0077:   -1, no MOT, no bias
20231208 - 0078:   -1, no MOT, no bias
20231208 - 0079:   -1, no MOT, no bias
20231208 - 0080:   -1, no MOT, no bias
20231208 - 0081:   -1, no MOT, no bias
20231208 - 0082:   -1, no MOT, no bias
20231208 - 0083:   -1, no MOT, no bias -> spifnlip at 15ms
20231211 - 0004:   Maybe the issue with pulses?
20231211 - 0005:   Hmm, is this still with the old probe pulses? Let's use a different script. Should fix this one as well.
20231211 - 0007:   Nice nice
20231211 - 0008:   Straight to ODT I'd say and check the contrast with x comp. If those are the same, then we are riding high.
20231211 - 0010:   I'm going straight to ODT, I don't care. I need to know.
20231211 - 0011:   To OAH. At 15ms spinflip time, and with X comp maxed out.
20231211 - 0012:   Need to open the beams and detune
20231211 - 0013:   On resonance still here. Let's detune the light and do it again. But I don't think I like the way it looks, tbh
20231211 - 0014:   ^----- 15 ms spinflip time. Cool, nice. Take 5 here, then go take 5 at 95 ms spinflip
20231211 - 0015:   15 ms
20231211 - 0016:   15 ms
20231211 - 0017:   15 ms
20231211 - 0018:   15 ms

20231211 - 0022:   95 ms
20231211 - 0023:   95 ms
20231211 - 0024:   95 ms
20231211 - 0025:   95 ms
20231211 - 0029:   Still not condensed
20231211 - 0033:   Not quite condensed - the contrast here seems pretty similar I'd say
20231211 - 0035:   Ohh, becuase I release it form the trapp, what an idiot
20231211 - 0041:   From here. In the MT -> with -1 atoms, 10 frames. Should be enough. Check for the contrast
20231211 - 0042:   Empty. Go check if we lost the lasers/
20231211 - 0043:   yeah, lasers got unlocked. So from the next next one. Let it run
20231211 - 0046:   still nothing
20231211 - 0047:   Well, everthing works, everything is there, but no atoms? Too much cooling? Try 19s
20231211 - 0048:   MOT is there
20231211 - 0050:   HERE - Alright, it's here. Keep it running here.
20231211 - 0051:   HERE
20231211 - 0052:   HERE
20231211 - 0053:   Why is it just gone?
20231211 - 0056:   Still too much cooling? Go to 16s
20231211 - 0057:   The hell?
20231211 - 0058:   Go to thermal cloud, just before the transfer to ODT
20231211 - 0067:   Run it now with a big finetune bias. After 540 seconds (5 runs ish), change the spinflip time
20231211 - 0103:   Try the same thing, with y comp off  - 95 ms spinflip
20231211 - 0104:   95 ms
20231211 - 0105:   95 ms
20231211 - 0106:   95 ms - These images are not good at all.
20231211 - 0107:   95 ms
20231211 - 0108:   95 ms
20231211 - 0109:   15 ms
20231211 - 0110:   15 ms
20231211 - 0111:   15 ms

20231211 - 0115:   15 ms
20231211 - 0116:   15 ms
20231212 - 0001:   What's going on towards the right of the frame? Somehow beams a bit messy? Maybe we need to raise the ref powers or something?
20231212 - 0003:   Go to less frames, this analysis takes a long time.
20231212 - 0028:   something off with the beams again
20231212 - 0049:   Lost it here
20231212 - 0069:   Shit
20231212 - 0070:   Ultra shit
20231212 - 0073:   It's here but still a bit shit, what the hell is going on?
20231212 - 0077:   Try t light at 200 - better I guess, but OAH1 is still so so bad, why?
20231212 - 0078:   Let's run a list - with y comp varying - maybe let's do 25 frames. Also, we have no nitrogen, something to keep in mind. Also laser powers are shit shit today.
20231212 - 0079:   Looks okay actually. Go with 25 frames per shot - do we have little axial mode? Oh wait, maybe the shit frames we saw were due to the B field in the z direction? Wouldn't that be something.
20231212 - 0080:   ycomp varying, 25 frames
20231212 - 0089:   
20231212 - 0090:   
20231212 - 0091:   
20231212 - 0095:   
20231212 - 0096:   
20231212 - 0097:   
20231212 - 0098:   
20231212 - 0108:   
20231212 - 0109:   Practically empty. - Might have done that with light?
20231212 - 0110:   /
20231212 - 0111:   /
20231213 - 0000:   Run the list with switching the current!
20231213 - 0005:   Run the list with ycom inverted
20231213 - 0012:   What the hell is going on with the OAH beams tho?
20231213 - 0013:   Fix the beams and re-take the data
20231213 - 0023:   Empty.
20231213 - 0026:   lost atoms
20231213 - 0049:   ll re-run the first shots as well, some of them are a bit shit
20231213 - 0051:   Some sort of higher order interference?
20231213 - 0052:   Seem a bit better, if we need it.
20231213 - 0061:   
20231214 - 0004:   something for sure off with the overlap? left part of the picure is just fully weird.
20231214 - 0011:   Let's take a few full frame shots, see how the interference looks there. Empty otherwise, it might be that the gradient we apply during the cooling is too much.
20231214 - 0025:   Ugh so shit - But the condensate is here, visible. Why so shit tho? Checking interference, it does look a bit shit. Let's try taking just the image of the reference beams, each, and just of the probe.
20231214 - 0027:   Ugh what? This is intereting, to say the least. With lights on tho, but very indicative
20231214 - 0028:   Just the probe
20231214 - 0029:   What the fuck? This probe is fucked? Check just the references
20231214 - 0030:   Try S and then P
20231214 - 0031:   This is just one of them - looks okay. try now the other one.
20231214 - 0032:   definetely a bit worse, this other one. Does this seem like a camera issue even? Just the probe now.
20231214 - 0033:   Blew some dust off the lenses, try again. But this is odd, could it be a camera issue? Probably not right, otherwise we'd see it also in other beams
20231214 - 0035:   try lower tlight
20231214 - 0036:   What, this seems to work? Problem with tlight???? This is at 25 us. Try again, just to confirm
20231214 - 0037:   Try with all the beams open
20231214 - 0038:   What the helllllll
20231214 - 0040:   Holy shit what the hell. Some sort of interference that we don't want
20231214 - 0054:   Kinda looks okay at 250us t_light? Try taking some shots here.
20231214 - 0055:   OAH 2 is being a little bitch - Utter shit
20231214 - 0056:   OAH 1 nice, OAH2 not so nice. But it seems like some motion? Try lower MOT gradient
20231214 - 0057:   SOmething is wrong with the second beam - poor interference, or it could be just at that part there. Yeah, it's there but it's also everywhere - should all be in -1, by the way
20231214 - 0119:   Still here. After all this time
20231214 - 0129:   Do the list of changing t_ight
20231215 - 0010:   we're set in OAH, so that's why we don't see anything, rihgt?
20231215 - 0051:   Let's keep some MOT field on during the cooling and make a magnet
20231215 - 0052:   All of a sudden it looks quite decent? huh?
20231215 - 0054:   Empty, all is gone. Too much MOT field for too long? Actually something is there, someting small. So maybe just the 0 spin remaining, could be, and we've blown away the -1 atoms. Make the frame smaller, and take many images. But why is
20231215 - 0055:   Empty though. try less MOT, go from 0.1 to 0.08
20231215 - 0058:   Also empty
20231215 - 0070:   Oh wait it is here, but shifted lower, much lower - did we touch a mirror and that messed it up? Slight alignment?
20231215 - 0074:   Maybe just no atoms?
20231215 - 0075:   I fear atoms might just be out of the frame - expand the POV to 300
20231215 - 0076:   Yep, the atoms moved towards bottom. Could try slightly adjusting the last mirror - the button closest to me, CCW
20231215 - 0077:   No big difference? At least we're not as sensitive, seems good. Maybe slightly to the right? Try the further button CCW
20231215 - 0079:   Lost them. Try going the other ways. B CW
20231215 - 0083:   Shit. All gone, can't find them. Try full frame
20231215 - 0085:   Fuck just fully gone?
20231215 - 0086:   Go to MT, should be bigger and brighter, and to make sure we're not just loosing it in ODT somewhere. Also, the MOT doesn't seem very bright, gotta say. Super shaky still
20231215 - 0092:   fuck
20231215 - 0125:   Uff all particles are still here, alignment is okayish, just we have little little particles. Probably laser powers.
20231215 - 0126:   Jinxed it of course - zeeman power was at 50 mW, but couldn't get it higher than 95mW - I feel like throughout the day, the zeeman shifts, and because it's so powerful it slowly degrades the fiber, so we lose power over time
20231215 - 0159:   Just empty? Fucking hellll why
20231215 - 0160:   I mean something is seriously off with the setup - with like everything. laser power low, the MOT looks faint, and shaky - Check another Laser 2 beam power. Like MOT. Also lower. Fuck me goddddd
20231215 - 0162:   Center at 1010, we need it at 1070
20231215 - 0164:   In the 100s of millinos - good but still shit. I mean laser powers are still massively shit
20231215 - 0166:   for fucks sake
20231215 - 0167:   everything is shit
20231215 - 0178:   Furthest clockwise
20231215 - 0180:   Maybe this is left right?
20231215 - 0183:   Closest CCW
20231215 - 0184:   Almost doesn't move. More , closest CCW
20231215 - 0185:   Up, but still gotta go higher
20231215 - 0186:   can I even move it lol?
20231215 - 0187:   try other axis. Other knob, CCW
20231215 - 0188:   Nice, but wrong way
20231215 - 0191:   Much more? Uf, alright, might wanna start touching an earlier mirror
20231215 - 0192:   Nice!!
20231215 - 0196:   Nice, within central 50 pxs
20231215 - 0198:   All beams. on resonance
20231215 - 0201:   Hmm, lost all particles?
20231215 - 0206:   reconstruction good, particle number embarasing - left it on HI?
20240108 - 0000:   I mean for zeeman at 100mW, mot xy at 20mW and mot z at 12 mW this is not too shabby
20240108 - 0005:   mental
20240108 - 0014:   Go to RF5 to check if fluctuations are also there.
20240108 - 0153:   Interesting. Kinda high, go to 60s cooling
20240108 - 0154:   Not shabby let's be positive
20240108 - 0155:   Not too bad.
20240108 - 0162:   Lovely. Small, but lovely. Check in situ
20240108 - 0164:   In situ. Shall we try to make it thicker?
20240108 - 0172:   should be with SG, but perhaps tof is too low. Increase that a bit
20240108 - 0176:   Even with shit laser powers, this looks quite nice
20240108 - 0177:   nevermind
20240108 - 0185:   from where
20240108 - 0189:   shut off
20240122 - 0008:   Ugh well the laser powers should be sufficient
20240122 - 0016:   This looks sad
20240122 - 0033:   pathetic
20240122 - 0080:   What the fuck? Where are we loosing them? MOT seems okayish
20240122 - 0086:   Looks empty
20240122 - 0090:   Ugh from where? Also still relatively low. Keep it running at 5 secs for a while, to see if MOT works okayish. Doesn't seem tho
20240122 - 0093:   blocked spinpol, doesn't seem to make a difference?
20240122 - 0094:   Let's run for a while with blocked spinpol
20240122 - 0095:   Alright, seems like that's a part of the problem?
20240122 - 0098:   Run it at 60 secs, the usual. See if that makes any difference, compared to before - all with spinpol blocked
20240122 - 0134:   
20240122 - 0135:   
20240122 - 0136:   
20240122 - 0137:   These are all with no spinpol. Try next couple with spinpol
20240122 - 0138:   I mean higher with spinpol for sure, but not quite as much as I'd hope
20240122 - 0139:   
20240122 - 0140:   
20240122 - 0141:   
20240122 - 0142:   Hm,. try again without?

20240122 - 0145:

20240207 - 0007:   750 us Ugh this feels so random
20240207 - 0008:   750 us
20240207 - 0009:   750 us Keep in mind, these are with spinpol time of 750us (raised it from previous 250 us). Let's try again at the lower spinpol time, and then of course higher. Let's see what the problem is, but it seems like it is something to do with the spinpolarization.
20240207 - 0010:   750 us Made it a variable as well. Next at 250 us
20240207 - 0014:   Doesn't seem to affect it that much.
20240207 - 0015:   Go to 750 to see if there's a difference
20240207 - 0020:   At higher spinpol time?
20240207 - 0021:   Interesting. Keep it running here a while

20240214 - 0161:   Other way
20240214 - 0184:   too far.
20240214 - 0185:   mmkay. Let's check the laser powers we're at now. This is experimentally determined maximum.
20240214 - 0186:   12 / 1.4 / 140 mW
20240214 - 0187:   ugh whatt, all I did was increased the Zeeman power. Should it be lower? :o
20240214 - 0189:   let's figure out why MOT repumper is so low - the top lens can be repositioned, which makes the difference of how much we block out.
20240214 - 0204:   let's move the lens thingy
20240214 - 0320:   T CW

20240215 - 0386:   This should be without the spinpol - all above without spinpol
20240216 - 0084:   Different max? Ughhh why did it change? Alignement?
20240216 - 0167:   eh, I hope it's clogged and we can clear it up, and increase the particle number. Let's try the ODT, see if everything is where we left it.
20240216 - 0169:   Hm. Wanna go to ODT? /sideeye/ Not phenomenal, but maybe maybe.
20240216 - 0172:   too much cooling.
20240219 - 0011:   Ughhhhh
20240219 - 0022:   Let's run the MOTcurr list - double check
20240219 - 0029:   max at 2.4
20240219 - 0151:   after further cooling
20240219 - 0152:   What the hell honestly haha. Where did this come from?
20240219 - 0186:   Let's do with some SG
20240219 - 0187:   It moveeedd
20240219 - 0189:   ipping
20240219 - 0192:   Losing it
20240219 - 0200:   fully empty. Lost it all
20240219 - 0202:   Still empty - go check on the laser powers.
20240219 - 0211:   Still a bit faint, ngl
20240219 - 0212:   Some thermal cloud
20240219 - 0213:   Camera gone wild here
20240219 - 0221:   Go restart the camera
20240219 - 0224:   Condensate here, nice and big, but camera fuckery
20240219 - 0227:   Let's restart and reload the wordgenerator as well
20240219 - 0230:   Still here. What the hell happened?
20240219 - 0231:   Not tof's fault
20240219 - 0232:   Try with a global shutter, rather. It kinda looks like that could be the issue
20240219 - 0234:   Alright, so it is the 100 us pulse, interesting.
20240219 - 0237:   Spinflip at 55. Apply a little bit of MOT
20240219 - 0241:   Shifted, but it seems like still all in -1 state. Try what Marc believed was about 50/50
20240219 - 0248:   Go to 95 ms
20240219 - 0249:   All the same. No spinflipping going on? Oh need to also change the wordgenerator spinflip time
20240219 - 0253:   Empty, too much MOT?
20240219 - 0260:   Maybe something funky going on?
20240219 - 0265:   Let's reproduce the 350 onem with double peak
20240219 - 0266:   Ugh why this bullshit now? Pulses messed up?
20240219 - 0269:   
20240219 - 0271:   Nice!
20240219 - 0272:   Give it some proper tof
20240219 - 0276:   Ugh
20240219 - 0278:   when tlight is 100us I get this shit again :(
20240219 - 0280:   Still only a single component
20240220 - 0070:   Maybe some splitting actually. Nicee
20240220 - 0073:   kinda empty
20240220 - 0078:   I htink there's splitting here, for sure. Right?
20240220 - 0095:   Ughh
20240221 - 0029:   God damn, this is no spinflipping, quite destroyed :(
20240307 - 0010:   All empty. Try less RF1
20240307 - 0012:   also empty.
20240307 - 0014:   Go check the lasers
20240307 - 0017:   atom shutter was off :(
20240307 - 0034:   Good enough for the ODT optimization I'd say
20240307 - 0043:   Eh small small. But let's see how it looks in ODT, and then think about changing that
20240307 - 0049:   
20240307 - 0056:   interesting
20240308 - 0017:   Looks like we have it, but just this little. Ugh - also no LN
20240308 - 0053:   lost lasers i guess
20240308 - 0067:   Good. Let's go ODT
20240308 - 0081:   Go to less tof, to get a better idea about the shape. Then change the beam diameter
20240308 - 0088:   Losing it? This should still be with the diaphragm fully open. Try without cooling, so that the laser beam power stays high the whole time
20240308 - 0089:   Closed the beam
20240308 - 0090:   empty - try no ODT cooling
20240308 - 0092:   Do it in situ though, this looks messy
20240308 - 0100:   well, there's your answer. Making it smaller expands it along the wrong axis.
20240308 - 0104:   ! Super funky though, try condensing but at higer powers of the laser.
20240308 - 0110:   Still here then we seem to lose it
20240308 - 0120:   it's here, just struggles with fitting it
20240308 - 0128:   lower cooling depth
20240308 - 0129:   With some tof. MIght want some more particles to see the shape.
20240308 - 0130:   Yeah, we have to expand the beam, not contract it. Let's see how we can do that - maybe we had some more in reserve with the diaphragm?
20240308 - 0135:   Also moved, right?
20240408 - 0099:   310 degrees
20240408 - 0102:   300 degrees

20240523 - 0202:   Lens the other way
20240523 - 0234:   longer RF time
20240527 - 0140:   modified the zeeman setup a bit
20240605 - 0004:   don't get it
20240605 - 0010:   I mean it doesn't seem like an outlier
20240605 - 0014:   well I mean this is at 5 more seconds cooling. Go to 15s
20240605 - 0017:   Still immensly lower than last time we checked at that point - was 2e9 ish
20240605 - 0022:   back to 5s cooling. Stop here, check tomorrow with nitrogen
20240605 - 0023:   Keep it running with the oven slowly cooling down. I've shut it off here
20240606 - 0004:   lets track it while it's getting warm
20240606 - 0015:   ramped up cooling to 30s - not promising at all - run a list
20240606 - 0106:   nitrogen really does make the difference
20240606 - 0209:   empty
20240905 - 0003:   Interference because forgot to close the ref beams, but oh so dirty. Goodness. Gotta check where that's from
20240905 - 0004:   What the actual hell is this? I mean looks cool but what
20240905 - 0005:   Bubbles remain on the same spot, so probably not something physical. Some imaging artefact. Let's check which image has it.
20240905 - 0100:   Try just the reference beams.
20240905 - 0102:   same shitty things with the camera I don't quite get.
20240905 - 0104:   For fuck's sake. Let's try global shutter, this looks like a rolling shutter issue. The little droplets still persist.
20240905 - 0106:   even worse.
20240905 - 0107:   idk, restart canera?
20240905 - 0108:   hm, better with lower tlight?
20240906 - 0036:   All empty.
20240909 - 0000:   As empty as my heart
20240909 - 0001:   keep it running for a while. This is at 5s RF1. Maybe my probe is not resonant?
20240909 - 0002:   
20240909 - 0003:   I mean the MOT is just not there
20240909 - 0004:   Keep at it for a while, thenplay with MOTcurr - also, started the nitrogen, let's see if that makes a difference. Also pressures still slightly rising.
20240909 - 0072:   All empty. Let's run through MOT currents
20240909 - 0075:   Let's first try without any TOF.
20240909 - 0077:   Still empty
20240909 - 0080:   Even with no tof - still empty
20240909 - 0085:   Some weird interference in the middle
20240909 - 0094:   changed RF1 to 1 sec
20240909 - 0098:   All empty
20240909 - 0231:   Aaalll emty
20240909 - 0243:   Shifted the frequencies for a sanity check
20240911 - 0019:   With higher probeshut it seems to disapear, but also, does it move towards the right?
20240911 - 0020:   
20240911 - 0021:   Let's do a list and see it move, I guess
20240911 - 0032:   Kinda loosing it in the next one - could be lasers
20240911 - 0065:   Just seems to be very big, strange.
20240911 - 0066:   still, same. Just seems like it's exploaded.
20240911 - 0067:   with atoms shutter off.
20240911 - 0118:   The problem is that at 40 ms probeshut (which we need for the camera pulse problems), we already don't see anything. And the light we see on other frames is surely still from the laser.
20240911 - 0120:   try turning on MT
20240911 - 0121:   empty ish? I mean this light could also just be because the lasers are still on just until we image. So it could just be some sort of a laser thing - which makes sense, given that it's not a dip - not an absorption
20240911 - 0122:   Fully empty.
20240911 - 0124:   I think it's fairly clear I get nothing in my MT
20240911 - 0131:   empty
20240911 - 0132:   lasers kaput
20240911 - 0138:   Let's try the same, making sure we don't have MOT. Close the atom shutter.
20240911 - 0140:   Still here. SO these are not atoms.
20240911 - 0152:   Hm, let's properly check this in the lab
20240911 - 0154:   without the Zeeman coils, I get nothing. So it is a MOT what we're seeing?
20240911 - 0156:   Zeeman coils back on, back having it.
20240911 - 0157:   Closed k4, is gone.
20240911 - 0159:   locked the lasers to a different transition, gone. So it is a MOT!
20240911 - 0162:   Even after a second of loading we have it.
20240912 - 0005:   All empty
20240912 - 0015:   Alright, lesser?
20240912 - 0025:   So even with keeping the MOT coils on, I'm still loosing it. So it's gotta be the MT that messes it up.
20240916 - 0000:   Classic empty image. Where we left it. Fun.
20240916 - 0006:   empty, when using a script from 1.5 years ago
20240916 - 0010:   hm okay, something different
20240916 - 0012:   way dark. Interesting, why is that?
20240916 - 0022:   Rolling shutter vs ...
20240916 - 0023:   .. global. Same shit, more or less
20240916 - 0043:   No idea what's up, maybe we're missing it?
20240916 - 0044:   
20240916 - 0050:   Tried with side imaging. It also seems empty. But somethow the image seems more correct, also the raw version of it. Maybe it is the fact that we're hitting it more straight on. Try the MOT imaging we had a few days ago.
20240916 - 0051:   a big mess
20240917 - 0000:   atoms picture is empty. Why. Try with more probeshut time
20240917 - 0005:   Also, switch to top imaging
20240917 - 0007:   Some speck on the bottom? But it's on both atoms and flat, so don't think that's something atomic.
20240917 - 0008:   Cleaned a bit with air, let's see if it helps
20240917 - 0009:   cleaner - still empty. I changed the sequence and deleted all un-needed steps. Should be MVP for trapping up to 60 secs RF. Still struggling with camera pretrigger it seems.
20240917 - 0010:   no tof - empty. Let's lower probeshut, and change the timescale on the channel before to ms. Maybe that's the issue?
20240917 - 0012:   no, doesn't work - doesn't take the image for some reason. I don't get that
20240917 - 0014:   Same ugh
20240917 - 0016:   nah.
20240917 - 0017:   Oh, it might be the probe shutter - lollll it's literally in the name.
20240917 - 0018:   Alright, figured that out
20240917 - 0028:   Still in the MT when I flash it just before the imaging. Strange.
20240917 - 0036:   maybe let's try not turning off the MT when imaging?
20240917 - 0042:   idk, I don't get it. Try blasting it during the imaging channel.
20240917 - 0044:   when I preview each frame there seems to be some fluorescence in the first one? Try again to make sure - also turned off probe, just in case.
20240917 - 0047:   Looks empty here, but looks like we're seeing something on the fluorescent imaging. If I can call it that.
20240917 - 0048:   To be sure, let's not load any atoms, and see if it's still there.
20240917 - 0049:   Nothing here. It is fluorescence, and it does seem to be in the center. But, maybe a bit too big of a cloud? Let's try cooling more, see if it changes
20240917 - 0057:   Have a look at these images in raw. You can see fluorescence.
20240917 - 0058:   Hm. It's strange that mot xy shutter can be this fast - let's try with AOM blasting instead, and leave the shutter open
20240917 - 0059:   Although I guess the exposure time is long enough. The atoms (fluorescence) still there. Alright, I'm okay with this. The problem I have is that with a tof of 10 ms the atmos are still there, absolutley normally. Go to something like 50ms
20240917 - 0060:   even at 50 ms, still the fluorescent cloud. Go to 500ms, surely everyhting should be gone by here.
20240923 - 0000:   Atomsss
20240923 - 0003:   Let's give it some tof.
20240923 - 0006:   empty - also this weird thing in the middle, like some weird light profile.
20240923 - 0010:   soemthing strange is going on with the imaging, I think. The profiles for atoms and flat are not the same.
20240923 - 0011:   all empty.
20240923 - 0012:   maybe the TOF kinda messes it up?
20240923 - 0014:   works with no tof. Still fairly spotty.

20240927 - 0086:   let's check at lower tlight
20240927 - 0088:   messes it up fully - for some reason cannot do it with lower tlight it seems
20240927 - 0089:   nothing at 25
20241010 - 0055:   Run as a funciton of spinpol_time
20241011 - 0133:   Started nitrogen here.
20241011 - 0277:   !!! Condensates are back
20241011 - 0289:   
20241011 - 0360:   After messing around with the probe beam orientation, and I mean fully, we can image again with 25 us probe, and the interference is gone. I don't know anymore what reality is.
20241011 - 0363:   Althouth a different kind of shit appears.
20241014 - 0052:   why would it just randomly be empty?
20241014 - 0062:   tlight 200
20241014 - 0068:   
20241014 - 0103:   MOT R - T CC
20241014 - 0294:   let's check if we have that switching behaviour
20241014 - 0305:   This was after a rest - no effect ogf waiting
20241014 - 0306:   
20241014 - 0307:   go to higher tlight and try again
20241014 - 0312:   definetely no effect - wht the hell
20241014 - 0321:   less tlight better, for sure
20241014 - 0326:   Def no effect here either
20241014 - 0374:   okay so there is a sweet spot
20241014 - 0375:   for the repumper power distro
20241014 - 0520:   oven off
20241017 - 0015:   start temp
20241017 - 0095:   Way less particles as before, on monday e.g.
20241017 - 0119:   well I'll be damned - nitrogen finally kicked in, or some other drifting effect?
20241017 - 0170:   looks dope - cool more, let's get condensates
20241017 - 0182:   Eyo baby
20241017 - 0185:   my boys are condensing, look at them. I might shed a tear
20241017 - 0212:   Back to 60 secs
20241017 - 0228:   ugh losing it massively. Come on nitrogen
20241017 - 0257:   nitrogen kicking in - quite a bit slow though, isn't it?
20241017 - 0263:   That's dope. Let's see how big our condensates are.
20241017 - 0269:   medium condensed. But mega big
20241017 - 0270:   Oh boy bigg boy
20241017 - 0271:   those are some great numbers
20241017 - 0272:   empty almost
20241017 - 0275:   empty
20241017 - 0277:   Empty. Either cooling too much or something else is wrong. Let's lower the cooling, then go check
20241017 - 0282:   Pff still here and so condensed. Boy, massive buddy.
20241017 - 0283:   Try even less cooling, we want it not condensed for the transfer.
20241017 - 0286:   Thermal only, at sub 2uK. Should be fine, right?
20241017 - 0299:   empty :/ Check the overlap by leaving both on.
20241017 - 0304:   empty. Does not bode well
20241017 - 0305:   Try not disabling the MOT at all
20241017 - 0308:   The cloud is here, no trace of any laser light. Fun. Try more tof and keep the IR laser on for longer. Here it was on during the tof, but maybe we need to go longer still.
20241017 - 0312:   Nothing - the idea was that maybe the laser beam would've caught some of the atoms in the free expansion, but no luck. Tomorrow let's re-align the IR beam.
20241018 - 0001:   Good starttt
20241018 - 0011:   Seems to oscillate a bit, eh?
20241018 - 0015:   Opa the big 4-0-0
20241018 - 0020:   Let's run a list of cooling
20241018 - 0037:   This is at about 1uK and it seems not too condensed yet. Let's try to see if it's reliable here, then pop up the IR boy.
20241018 - 0038:   Condensation appears here.
20241018 - 0042:   Modified the RF curves, the effect seems pretty violent - almost pure.
20241018 - 0044:   pretty much pure
20241018 - 0066:   Condensation is here though.
20241018 - 0102:   This seems just before the condensation. Let's eat, then align the IR. I want to recheck the RF curves though, the efficiency seems odd?
20241018 - 0103:   Starting the list
20241018 - 0167:   All troubleshooting and fluorescence
20241018 - 0179:   No laser - but 80 M at this stage aint too shabby
20241018 - 0181:   still nothing
20241018 - 0183:   laser was not on, technically. Let's try again
20241018 - 0194:   I think the wrong control was hooked up to amp control on the aom
20241018 - 0196:   naah
20241021 - 0008:   quite a bit low?
20241021 - 0024:   I mean nitrogen and everything should be fine by now?
20241021 - 0026:   picking up the pace
20241021 - 0070:   Looks stableish
20241021 - 0133:   try some IR dipole stuff - figure out why it doesnt work
20241021 - 0185:   MT off from here
20241022 - 0001:   of course everything is fucked.
20241022 - 0002:   maybe just too much light. But dark is not dark at all.
20241022 - 0041:   Let's run a list of different IR laser AOM frequencies
20241022 - 0051:   some interesting profile in the middle maybe?
20241022 - 0088:   still empty, after realigning
20241022 - 0107:   Yeah you can tell with lower tof's that we're not hitting it properly
20241022 - 0108:   changing the ODT frequency by 1 V (in WG) seems to make no difference. Let's go to 0. We should also probably check what angle that corresponds to
20241022 - 0110:   Feels like it doesn't change at all the angle. go to -10
20241022 - 0113:   Oh silly me, I still had it set to 10 at Start MT as a way of sending a trigger for the temperature measurements. Try again. Start at 10, next one at 9
20241022 - 0115:   Okay, well, it moved, I suspect out of the image - can't see it. Try less.
20241022 - 0118:   Maybe a little bit there? I think we need to manually move it a bit. Let's set it to 10 V and manually start shifting it. No luck, it seems
20241022 - 0119:   B tiny CCW
20241022 - 0120:   Ouh fucking hot. This was such a tiny correction of the mirror, and look at this amazing beauty. the problem is that this is at the limit of the AOM frequency, so we need to move it a bit more, overshoot it intentionally. Otherwise this is close to perfect man
20241022 - 0121:   Still pretty solid.
20241022 - 0122:   better, in a sense that we might be able to compensate with the AOM. Let's check at 9 V drive. And then move it more. We should have it at 0, probs?
20241022 - 0123:   kewl. Let's check if we can fix it with the AOM
20241022 - 0127:   15 px of shift per 1 V change - lower voltage shifts it downwards.
20241022 - 0131:   beauty. I wanna check the shaking as well.
20241022 - 0138:   !! UUuhhhh mammma, we have condensates in the dipole trap. Funky little wavey pattern, as familiar. Hello old friends. Welcome back.
20241022 - 0139:   !!! What the hell? Little sperm boy? Some sort of a dipole motion? Let's try more tof
20241022 - 0140:   What was the storry with the lines again - slower cooling? Let's go from 1250 -> 3000 ms cooling.
20241022 - 0141:   Next one - try more cooling
20241022 - 0142:   Hard to say if the lines go away. Let's go to 5 s cooling. Also wanna see in situ
20241022 - 0145:   Okay, turned on modulation of the trap - scanning at 10 kHz, with an amplitude of 1V around the center frequency that we have here - 4 V. Comeon baby
20241022 - 0146:   It's a little bit shorter, but not much thicker I feel. Try higher amplitude
20241022 - 0147:   It looks like we're leaking out of the trap at the end - we should fix that at some point. Perhaps we're tilted a bit.
20241022 - 0148:   Definetely not thicker. Try without a cooling, for fun
20241022 - 0149:   Yeah, just I guess a big cloud, too big to be contained in a ODT. Not much broader. Try at 1kHz oscillations
20241022 - 0150:   Still nothing. Try even slower?
20241022 - 0151:   empty
20241022 - 0152:   gotta be the scan too slow
20241022 - 0162:   its here but pretty much not wide - go to max amplitude I can afford.
20241022 - 0164:   doesnt feel much larger, does it
20241022 - 0165:   Wouter says in his thesis that he kept the MT on a bit longer, let's see how that looks. Just scanning doens't do jack, does it
20241022 - 0166:   Well, that's interesting. Let me compare with no scanning
20241022 - 0167:   it's the same, so it's not the scanning that makes the difference.
20241022 - 0168:   try again with increasing the time resolution to 10us, from 1 ms. Include the scan. I imagine it should give me better results? Otherwise it might be worth doing what Wouter said, and output 15 values only, and scan between them with 20kHz frequency
20241022 - 0169:   Hold up, there seems to be something funky going on. In terms of the scanning amplitude we should see something super broad, but the amplitude is not optimized for that anyway. Might be worth playing with that as well?
20241022 - 0170:   It seems to crash if I go to lower resolutions. But definetely I see a second line, or something like it. Let's try condensing and seeing where we are
20241022 - 0171:   empty.
20241022 - 0172:   !! damn maybe it moved? Much smaller, and also it's funky and wavey.
20241022 - 0173:   Trying with higher frequency, and also, let's try next one with lower amplitide. Might be too much? Odd.
20241022 - 0174:   This boy is big. the only thing I changed was the frequency, right. Hm. Not thicker though
20241022 - 0175:   No change. Let's perhaps try really small amounts, and also, let's try to compensate for the amplitude change
20241022 - 0177:   no change - try a GHz scanning frequency
20241022 - 0178:   forgot to turn it on.
20241022 - 0179:   try no cooling, but sweeping also the amplitude of the AOM. This way, when we are at the extremes, the amplitude should compensate for the lower efficiency. Ideally. Would be epic, wouldn't it.
20241022 - 0180:   Interesting, maybe a bit? I think it moved? Definitely moved.
20241022 - 0181:   Moved, and it stayed there. Does that mean the sweep is too slow? Go up by a factor of 1000
20241022 - 0182:   Moved again. And by moved I mean it stayed at origin. Is it a bit bigger maybe? Let's increase the amplitude of frequency sweep, or maybe the amplitude of the amplitude sweep?
20241022 - 0183:   The problem here will be cooling. We'll need to multiply two equations together, or something. Maybe it is bigger actually. ?
20241022 - 0184:   try with higher trap. Then we focus on the whole cooling thing. Which might be fun
20241022 - 0185:   Still here it seems! So now in the middle, if my calculations are correct, we should have a power of the beam of 0.5V, which should give us nothing (next one). However, in the wings, should be higher? This could be funky, or just empty haha
20241022 - 0186:   Still here. Interesting. Let me try to tof it, to see if we are condensed.
20241022 - 0187:   Very interesting, ngl. Might also be that the trap is not deep enough and we just have more atoms still, at higher temperatures.
20241022 - 0188:   yeah, not condensed at all. Alright. Changed the curves, this will be mad if it works.
20241022 - 0189:   Right, full on empty lol. try less tof
20241022 - 0191:   fuck ,empty. shame. Would be nice. What I planned didn't work.
20241022 - 0192:   hold up, something is here. Maybe just cooling too much? That could be? Super thin though.
20241022 - 0193:   It's here, but it does not bode well for the bigger trap.
20241022 - 0194:   okay oaky, so it's here. But not any wider, I'm afraid. I should call it soon though. Unless I pull a longer one today, and work from home tomorrow. Or just come in later I guess.
20241022 - 0195:   to be fair, I wasn't cooling in the ODT, but while we were still in the MT. Could play a role. Let's fix that. I mean this is just craziness. The curves I defined now are full on crazy, we are oscillating and at the same time cooling, and at the same time compensating for the change in the AOM efficiency.
20241022 - 0196:   this is at 1.3 cooling. Let's go to 2, where we saw it before.
20241022 - 0200:   Oh hello. why all of a sudden? I just let it run for 6 runs, and then it appeared. Why?
20241022 - 0201:   I have no idea how any of it works anymore. Go to 1.8 cooling
20241022 - 0202:   Looks pretty good, ngl. A little gaussian
20241022 - 0204:   is looking a bit more condensed. Lemme count them particles real quick.
20241022 - 0205:   mm okay, let's check at 0.7
20241022 - 0209:   looks fat
20241022 - 0210:   I mean it looks pretty big in situ, we might need to check that we really have a BEC, probably needs a little bit more cooling.
20241022 - 0211:   
20241022 - 0215:   Too much tof for not enough cooling?
20241022 - 0218:   Still seems kinda empty - lemme check with old cooling curves and no funky business.
20241022 - 0220:   Yeah shit, this is immediatelly much bigger and better. Still super wonky and stripey though, quite interesting.
20241022 - 0222:   looks condensed. But I mean look at the shape of this. Let's cool for 7000 ms
20241022 - 0223:   !! What the hell. try more cooling.
20241022 - 0224:   more diffused, but also smaller. Ugh. try way faster cooling.
20241022 - 0225:   much more stripy, gotta be related to that. It's surely the effect. But also seems like dripping out. Few last shots.
20241022 - 0227:   no cooling, so much bigger, obv.
20241022 - 0228:   !! Ohhhh shit shit holdup, this looks like wide boy.
20241022 - 0229:   Fuck it works. Lemme try a larger frequency sweep amplitude - if it works the way I think it works, we should see a larger spread
20241022 - 0230:   Defienetly bigger, but also fainter. Let's figure that out.
20241022 - 0232:   !! What we want! No cooling of course, but step in the right direction. It kinda looks like two traps.
20241022 - 0233:   Next one should just be identical, a sanity check for changing the curves to a templeta one.
20241022 - 0240:   !! Looks lovely
20241024 - 0019:   I guess still waiting for the nitrogen to start flowing
20241024 - 0028:   picking up
20241024 - 0048:   Much smaller, and much colder.
20241024 - 0050:   Try more cooling
20241024 - 0053:   Should've just left it here - I modified the curves slightly, went from 2.55 to 2.45 as the final value - also, perhaps a longer tof would show the difference in the expensions better.
20241024 - 0060:   Very nice actually.
20241024 - 0064:   Nice
20241024 - 0065:   Alright, we got some nice mixtures here - let's see what we have at one more s of cooling
20241024 - 0069:   starting to lose it
20241024 - 0070:   let me check the nitrogen, it's starting to look faint.
20241024 - 0071:   nitrogen is out
20241024 - 0072:   Aint too shabby
20241024 - 0078:   empty, fully losing it now
20241024 - 0097:   Seems like we lost the MOT. Let's check
20241024 - 0120:   Alright, seems like we're back
20241024 - 0124:   Hm, odd. Let's keep it running here
20241024 - 0126:   Lower the RF
20241024 - 0151:   looks pretty pure
20241025 - 0077:   shaking the trap. Works
20241025 - 0080:   okay, its' here. Nice
20241025 - 0093:   Try only modulating the frequency, leave the trap. We should also look into making the triangular wave.
20241025 - 0094:   Let's try cooling
20241025 - 0095:   Let's now try with cooling and some more tof. Could also run a list of tofs, to check the trapping frequencies
20241025 - 0096:   empty. Maybe cooling too low, maybe too much tof.
20241025 - 0097:   still empty - try higher lowest power, less tof
20241025 - 0098:   still empty. No cooling and still shaky trap worked. so we're just loosing it somewhere
20241025 - 0100:   It's here. Let's run it for a bit more
20241025 - 0101:   Looks a bit better - don't forget, this is with 4ms tof - let's run a normal trap and then tof it, to get some data for Daniel to analyse
20241025 - 0107:   Woah, hm ?
20241025 - 0110:   Why is there nothing here. Check at 60s, then 76
20241025 - 0113:   Still at 4uk, should go even lower?
20241025 - 0117:   dipole trap
20241025 - 0118:   Interesting. Not sure if it's cold enough
20241025 - 0120:   Looks kinda condensed - try more tof, then run a list
20241025 - 0122:   lovely. do a list
20241025 - 0123:   NO COOLING, FORGOT MT ON, but not really. It was still dissabled.
20241025 - 0148:   NO COOLING BUT NO MT
20241025 - 0152:   AGain, but this time turning off the PB and the rest in a controlled way.
20241025 - 0157:   stripess with the B field.
20241025 - 0175:   Gone - too much cooling?
20241025 - 0181:   It's here, seem condensed
20241025 - 0182:   Reset this, with modified cooling. Take it from here.
20241025 - 0183:   Sooo funky though
20241025 - 0184:   WITH COOLING
20241025 - 0188:   holly molly whyyy
20241025 - 0193:   !! My goddd
20241028 - 0003:   some weird stripy behaviour
20241028 - 0005:   weird interference pattern, better check at some point.
20241028 - 0010:   Coming up again - nitrgoen
20241028 - 0016:   lekkertje
20241028 - 0031:   curves might not be modified? As in the binary RF signal.
20241028 - 0032:   Right - I need a longer RF Hold time
20241028 - 0033:   nice.
20241028 - 0047:   let's give it some tof.
20241028 - 0049:   with 20ms tof, we get a nice expansion. Let's run over cooling depths to see where the proper condensation occurs. Or should we go straight to shaking the trap?
20241028 - 0050:   it moves, shot to shot
20241028 - 0082:   gone.
20241028 - 0110:   Okay, hooked up the wavegenerator, made a 10kHz triangular wave, offset at 4V, amplitude 2V (it's max setting).
20241028 - 0118:   empty.
20241028 - 0119:   empty. Hm
20241028 - 0120:   All too much maybe? Let's keep the amplitude higher still, maybe that's it? We had that in the past
20241028 - 0123:   Okay okay. something is here. Move quite higher up tho. Oh I need to check actually how the frequency of the cicero corresponds - voltage actually I mean. I think it should be less.
20241028 - 0125:   fuck, nothing. But I matched it to the previous settings
20241028 - 0126:   why doesn't it work?
20241028 - 0128:   No cooling, it's here. Funky, it seems like it's pushed all to one side.
20241028 - 0129:   introduce some cooling. Until we start loosing it. Maybe do a list.
20241028 - 0130:   first just with the step, no cooling yet
20241028 - 0131:   still here.
20241028 - 0134:   Chekc the cooling - 6 down to more or less zero
20241028 - 0137:   still here
20241028 - 0150:   Looks funky. I wonder what happens if I increase the amplitude of the oscillations even more
20241028 - 0158:   interesting, similar to what I had.
20241028 - 0180:   Hell, this makes no sense
20241028 - 0189:   okay, gone here.
20241028 - 0192:   it's not updating the fucking values
20241028 - 0197:   bijna gone
20241028 - 0211:   upped the frequency - is this now even worse? from 10 to 20kHz
20241028 - 0212:   I think this definetely had an impact. The edges are now even more pronounced. So it is something with that.
20241028 - 0213:   Let me try tof.
20241028 - 0215:   changed frequency to 40kHz
20241028 - 0216:   Would say even more pronoucned. Let's increase the amplitude, trying to bring it more apart from 1.3 Vpp to 2.08 Vpp
20241028 - 0217:   more apart, more atoms in the upper one.
20241028 - 0218:   similar to the previous one - maybe I can try playing with the offset - iirc we need to lower the voltage
20241028 - 0219:   ofsfet = 0.8, amplitude 1.3 Vpp
20241028 - 0221:   Alright, lower, but still doubled
20241028 - 0222:   try different shape = now sawtooth shape. before triangles
20241028 - 0224:   Interesting. Fully losing it? Only the lower one - nope, I think just the middle.
20241028 - 0225:   little bit of something here, a bit broader
20241028 - 0228:   lower frequency to 5 kHz
20241028 - 0229:   fainter, go to max frequency of 200kHz
20241028 - 0230:   single line - is it thicker, or is the scan way too fast?
20241028 - 0232:   Switch to sine wave
20241028 - 0233:   idk, is it thicker?
20241028 - 0234:   I mean it feels thicker, right? Lemme check with no modulation.
20241028 - 0235:   not condensed. Try some inbetween freq, like 100kHz
20241028 - 0236:   better condensed go to 100khz and check in situ
20241028 - 0237:   I mean basically two independent lines. I mean this could be interesting to investigate as well, can we make it a feature. With amplitude scan we could combine them. That'd be pretty wild.
20241028 - 0238:   yeah, one of the lines becomes more faint. at 150kHz
20241028 - 0240:   Mkay, interesting. let's shut it off, and try to check the laser profile.
20241028 - 0241:   empty.
20241029 - 0001:   Lots of tof, the numbers seem high? But the right ball park, so hard to say
20241029 - 0042:   I also want to check the trapping frequncies in the MT. Would be interesting to know.
20241029 - 0043:   So let's condense, then kick the trap, and image after a variable hold time, in situ
20241029 - 0044:   Let's just try with the TC kick
20241029 - 0046:   okay, let's see if it moves. Check at different times
20241029 - 0058:   Feels like no difference. try more of a kick
20241029 - 0062:   Looks quite destroyed. Try less of a kick, 3V
20241029 - 0083:   gone?
20241029 - 0084:   Doesn't seem to move tho. Try modifying the MOT curves, inspired by an old script. Seems to move a bit, I'll just run a list, and fingers crossed.
20241029 - 0086:   I think it for sure moved
20241029 - 0087:   Start the list
20241029 - 0108:   That's really big, that's what she said
20241029 - 0110:   Lemme try with more kick
20241029 - 0114:   seems like motion left-right, but not so much up-down
20241029 - 0128:   Should we just try some OAH? Maybe, feeling brave? To determine the trapping frequencies. Let's see first if we have a condensate, with some tof. At 19 sec cooling.
20241029 - 0129:   Not condensed. Go to 22secs
20241029 - 0131:   Still not condensed
20241029 - 0132:   More cooling
20241029 - 0133:   Same issue as last time, capping at 20s. Now fixed, go again. Check at 22s
20241029 - 0134:   little condensation in the middle? Let's do more tof, and for sure more cooling. this is 26 seconds cooling, might be better to lower the curve
20241029 - 0136:   Ye boy, the condensation appears - still thermal cloud, though
20241029 - 0149:   Lekker condensed. Let's see a second more
20241029 - 0150:   I mean it's pretty lekker. One more then let's go to OAH
20241029 - 0151:   Almost 100 percent.
20241029 - 0152:   Fun - no interference, nothing - buut, I pulled a Nejc, forgot a power meter in. let's try again
20241029 - 0153:   wooorks like a charm
20241029 - 0155:   go with 50 images now - OAH seems to work, very comparable to what we had
20241029 - 0156:   I seem to lose it
20241029 - 0158:   Ohh I forgot the MT shuts off inbetween
20241029 - 0159:   But good tof example
20241029 - 0160:   !! motion - maybe go to 1ms inbetween? Would it be out of the frame, potentialy? look at that thermal cloud
20241029 - 0161:   !! more or less just the condensate - let's repeat this with 200 images, and that should be it, to get our trapping freqs
20241029 - 0162:   Too much of a kick I reckon
20241029 - 0163:   200 images, but I expect its empty - also shocking, in the preview image I see no interference
20241029 - 0164:   !! 200 images, very lovely
20241031 - 0015:   Ugh I left the camera in the wrong settings
20241031 - 0016:   Let's try this again. Uf keep in mind we are far detuned. Opa. Gotta fix that as well
20241031 - 0143:   off
20241104 - 0057:   Okay,better, but still, where are all the particles?
20241104 - 0061:   Alright, nitrogen kicking in
20241104 - 0078:   Cool cool. Let's go to ODT
20241104 - 0079:   Empty. Not fully sure what the ODT trap is doing, lemme go check.
20241104 - 0080:   still empty
20241104 - 0102:   Lokks rather faint. Let me try with less perturbation, maybe less scanning frequency?
20241104 - 0107:   Let's try less cooling. Let me also check with the MT still on, maybe I'm hitting it worse now
20241104 - 0113:   pretty faint still
20241104 - 0114:   Hm kinda shittt
20241104 - 0117:   yep ,doesn't seem like we're hitting it
20241104 - 0120:   more tof
20241104 - 0122:   maybe not perfectly aligned
20241104 - 0123:   brghter, maybe a bit higher?
20241104 - 0126:   I'd say a bit too high
20241104 - 0138:   Try modifying the curves thorugh the computer interface. Set to 0.805
20241104 - 0139:   0.805
20241104 - 0140:   890, but barely seeing any difference. Go to 950, to check if it works. Then maybe loop it? Just establish the limits
20241104 - 0141:   950 This doesn't do anything, does it.
20241104 - 0142:   Okay way less. 1.3
20241104 - 0143:   700
20241104 - 0145:   600
20241104 - 0146:   650
20241104 - 0147:   680. Bro - lets try just running it and getting rid of the MT, and then making sure we have as many particles as possible.
20241104 - 0148:   680
20241104 - 0149:   720
20241104 - 0150:   820
20241104 - 0151:   880 - what the hell bro, it's dissapearing - try big big frequency, 200k
20241104 - 0152:   Seems better. it's a shame we can't just turn off the frequency, maybe if I just go minimal. Okay, check the offsets now.
20241104 - 0153:   800 - might be worth investing into decompressing the trap. Bring back some good old TC scripts.
20241104 - 0154:   0.9 Let's do some tof, just to see
20241104 - 0156:   now with proper tof
20241104 - 0157:   900
20241104 - 0158:   0.8 - worse. go to smallest frequency, and 0.0. Also try the lowest ampl
20241104 - 0159:   
20241104 - 0160:   Enabled decompression, let's see if it makes a difference, or if we're even still hitting it.
20241104 - 0161:   let's see without IR first.
20241104 - 0164:   still empty. Why.
20241104 - 0169:   whyyyyyyy
20241104 - 0170:   no clue why this doesn't work.Let's try no tof. Also try just the RF1, to check if we even still have it
20241104 - 0172:   fuck, it is still here. But pretty small.
20241104 - 0173:   still nothing
20241104 - 0175:   empty
20241104 - 0176:   Ohh I think I was cooling still through this stage. lolzie, try again. Everything, although also the particle number before the decompression seems prety low, ngl
20241104 - 0177:   now we're talking. let's try different decomp strengths
20241104 - 0178:   Then bring on the laser again.
20241104 - 0179:   Niceee, much better already. Try even more decomp - this is at 0.3
20241104 - 0180:   Noicee, but shifted ot the left, compensate with mot
20241104 - 0181:   Okay, very nice. let's try bring the IR
20241104 - 0182:   no lasertje, but good cloud. go to 700
20241104 - 0184:   0.900 - no laser - lower the decompression amount, and see when you start to lose it - then kinda walk it together, so you see where you have it
20241104 - 0186:   laser here
20241104 - 0187:   for some reason cannot get it lower.
20241104 - 0188:   I think I can still see the laser. Maybe might need to be moved a bit along the z axis
20241104 - 0189:   Losing it here it seems.
20241104 - 0191:   noice, pretty head on, but the decom amount was a bit too large. 3.350 instead of intended 0.350
20241104 - 0192:   780
20241104 - 0193:   680 - little bit of the laser is there.
20241104 - 0194:   check back at 680
20241104 - 0195:   little faint line is there.Maybe it is the z translation we should consider. Much trickier tofix, gotta go manual
20241104 - 0196:   685
20241104 - 0197:   more tof, we'll see better
20241104 - 0198:   there but hella weird. Looks kidna centered, but faint, as if we're passing behind/in front. We might need to go to the lab and start playing with the height
20241104 - 0200:   Let's go to the lab
20241104 - 0201:   685
20241104 - 0203:   better? 645, go to 625
20241104 - 0204:   maybe worse 625
20241104 - 0205:   635
20241104 - 0207:   lil bit clockwise, should go up, or something
20241104 - 0208:   maybe lil better, try more
20241104 - 0209:   ugh hard to say, hard - maybe be braver to see what's up
20241104 - 0210:   no idea bro, I guess better?
20241104 - 0212:   gonve
20241104 - 0217:   oven off losing it
20241104 - 0218:   oven ran out of heat it seems. Shut off for today
20241105 - 0016:   Looks stable ish
20241105 - 0033:   try more decompression
20241105 - 0038:   There's the laser, but also, odd odd.
20241105 - 0039:   0.755
20241105 - 0040:   0.755
20241105 - 0041:   0.855 - barely any difference
20241105 - 0043:   This is like 1.125V offset. I mean a change, but barelly, right
20241105 - 0045:   I mean am I even doing anything
20241105 - 0051:   Feels more like a repulsive interaction, no? Or maybe the tof displacet it, and the dark spot is where the laser is, but its actualy elsewhere because it's insitu
20241105 - 0052:   
20241105 - 0054:   0.7
20241105 - 0069:   Yeah, there's the dark spot - either a repulsive interaction of sorts, orrr that's the dark spot where the laser hit the atoms. The trick is now how do we optimize this
20241105 - 0073:   This is hard to judge. I mean definietely there's a laser there, we can see some effects of it, but I don't think we're hitting it particularly well.
20241105 - 0074:   less of a decompression, this repulsive artefact appears. What does that mean?
20241105 - 0079:   same old - does it mean that the laser is misaligned?
20241105 - 0082:   
20241105 - 0085:   Let's move the laser, 1.2 -> 0.7 V offset
20241105 - 0087:   moved
20241105 - 0089:   0.2
20241105 - 0092:   big move - 0.7 seems to work best. let's go to the lab and manually go up/down
20241105 - 0096:   better
20241105 - 0097:   MUUUUCH better
20241105 - 0099:   go to 0.6
20241105 - 0100:   more lower, tiny -> 0.4
20241105 - 0101:   maybe lil too much
20241105 - 0102:   les tof, this is with deceompression of 0.150
20241105 - 0103:   go to 0.001
20241105 - 0104:   interesting, it moved rightish? lest see with odt tof which one is better, I don't really feel like moving the focus, tbh
20241105 - 0105:   0.001
20241105 - 0106:   0.150
20241105 - 0108:   seems like 0.150 gives best
20241105 - 0109:   seems like 0.001 is less ideal. find ideal cooling time (rftime2)
20241105 - 0111:   run a cheeky list - keep in mind, we're checking the particle numbers in the ODT
20241105 - 0113:   lasers unlocked
20241105 - 0114:   Oh I should probs do cooling in the trap as well, because it's likely that the temperatures are much higher - i guess I can always look at the efficiency
20241105 - 0118:   this is getting worse? But 16 was where I had it before
20241105 - 0119:   why is it getting worse?
20241105 - 0120:   and then back to this. What the hell
20241105 - 0122:   let's condense more.
20241105 - 0125:   Ugh, doesn't quite condense nicely
20241105 - 0129:   Okay, condensate appears, nice!
20241105 - 0130:   but it feels much smaller than in the non-decompressed trap. Let me try it without the extra decompression, see if that makes it bigger - of course, it's probably missaligned
20241105 - 0131:   Not too bad I guess - need to go a little deeper, for a more pure condensate
20241105 - 0132:   Yeah I mean way bigger
20241105 - 0155:   uhm no, nitrogen was actualy fine
20241105 - 0156:   This feels like nitrogen running out. But it also feels like I have better transfer into the non-decompressed trap, even if not perfectly aligned, comapred to the decompressed one.
20241106 - 0021:   Ohh this is pretty cool actually. So500 I turned down the diameter of the two ref beams, and you can see nicely the two interferences.
20241106 - 0022:   sick. Let me try without the quarterwave plate. Should be only one interference, iirc
20241106 - 0023:   Uhm. Interesting, it kinda seems like the probe is somewhere in between. Let's try to rotate the half wave plate a bit, noting down where we started. But it's also apparent that one of the beams is much more interfering - at 103 degrees.
20241106 - 0024:   120 - seemed to go the wrong way. Let's go other way
20241106 - 0025:   80 - almost there, but now both are worse? try 90
20241106 - 0026:   90 seems
20241106 - 0027:   90 - that's it, really. One super obvious, the other not so much - I guess this is the correct one. basically trying to make the other peak dissapear
20241106 - 0028:   wrong way
20241106 - 0031:   No interference?
20241106 - 0034:   Open it a bit more
20241106 - 0036:   peaks are still circular - and you can see the shape still with the interference patterns
20241106 - 0037:   squared peaks.
20241107 - 0000:   R1 - the good reference beam
20241108 - 0020:   Left it on this - looks fairly clean, with nicely displaced beams.
20241108 - 0021:   sexy - not the biggest fan of the phase reconstruction though
20241111 - 0029:   well this is shite
20241111 - 0050:   something is off - let's go check, perhaps. Zeeman power?
20241111 - 0069:   nitrogen was on, but one of the valves was not attached well, and it was leaking. So connected it better now, should be running in a bit. Odd, I suspect they did something at the refilling station
20241111 - 0125:   im still struggling with the nitrogen, for some reason. Opened it much more now, let's hope it helps
20241111 - 0127:   up?
20241111 - 0135:   fcking finally, it's 2 pm, gosh
20241111 - 0154:   mm a bit low
20241111 - 0157:   disgustingly small. Might need to play around with laser powers
20241111 - 0176:   small small. Could be more condensed.
20241111 - 0189:   GOd this is hella small - still, try going to OAH
20241111 - 0193:   well that's pretty bad - let's keep running it, both quad analysis at 0 defocus
20241111 - 0200:   OAH 2 only - this is the ref beam closest to the breadboard.
20241111 - 0201:   OAH 2 only.
20241111 - 0202:   OAH 2 - max power in oah 2
20241111 - 0203:   OAH 1 Also fairly shit
20241111 - 0204:   OAH 1
20241111 - 0205:   OAH 1
20241111 - 0206:   Back to both, but empty
20241112 - 0011:   oh hello frend
20241112 - 0015:   am wat - lemme check how big the nitrogen flow is
20241112 - 0016:   looks kinda average, ngl
20241112 - 0037:   I mean mental, no?
20241112 - 0038:   lets go to RF2
20241112 - 0042:   holly molly we big
20241112 - 0045:   Let's make condensates
20241112 - 0071:   I mean still not even closed to fully condensed, lol
20241112 - 0082:   This is so big are you kidding me. Massive massive boy
20241112 - 0086:   Big big boy.
20241112 - 0091:   Look at this beauty, my wordd
20241112 - 0121:   Am.
20241112 - 0122:   Blah so bad, one of them is shittttt. Why, the power is much higher nowww
20241112 - 0123:   
20241112 - 0126:   OAH 1 is incredibly bad. Let's try redistribute the power. See if that helps.
20241112 - 0127:   Better without the condensate, but not much. the edges of OAH 1 still bad
20241112 - 0128:   OAH 2 works nicely. No BEC, so can't be that that messes it up. OAH 1 absolutley disgusting - maybe we're cutting wrong?
20241112 - 0129:   Maybe the B field? still empty
20241112 - 0130:   OAH 1 feels better again, idk what it is. Let's try with b fields on
20241112 - 0131:   no atoms - oah better
20241112 - 0132:   back to shiitt
20241112 - 0134:   hm, maybe a bti better, without the rf, try agan
20241112 - 0135:   nope, big shite in OAH1. Try without compressing the MT
20241112 - 0136:   Still baddd, try without start MT
20241112 - 0137:   maybe a bit better, let's confirm
20241112 - 0138:   mm don't know, hard to say. Still shit, maybe a bit less shit? Eh still shit.
20241112 - 0140:   i mean looks a bit better? Could it be random and just pwoer fluctuations?
20241112 - 0142:   I think this is better, disabled the extra depump. Let's reenable.
20241112 - 0143:   yaeh back to shit.
20241112 - 0145:   still shit even after reenabling it
20241112 - 0148:   Let me try reanalysing them again, rewrite the code. Perhaps we're not selecting the correct peak somehow.
20241112 - 0155:   hm, atom shutter seems to be the problematic one?
20241112 - 0160:   back to shit.
20241112 - 0161:   shit again, I have no idea waht's causing it.
20241112 - 0162:   all enabled back to good. Idk man. balanced the beam powers now, roughly. At least should be better than before
20241112 - 0165:   Where are all the atoms. OAH 1 still trash - perhaps some crosstalk and it's the reconstruction that fucks us?
20241112 - 0166:   Let's investigate each one individually.
20241112 - 0167:   OAH 1 only, but looks pretty nice.
20241112 - 0168:   Just do the OAH 2 now. But these are pretty good.
20241112 - 0169:   OAH1 only
20241112 - 0170:   Independently they both look pretty good. But together they get messyyy
20241112 - 0172:   Maybe one of the orders is too close to the 0th order. But how would that explain the single beam, ones?
20241120 - 0001:   Single image - Yo ho that looks epic actually. Let's just keep it here and keep taking these images. Vary cooling time and so on.
20241120 - 0002:   15 images, full frame, 10s cooling, 1 s between images
20241120 - 0003:   15 images, full frame, 10s cooling, 1 s between images
20241120 - 0004:   15 images, full frame, 10s cooling, 1 s between images
20241120 - 0005:   5 images, full frame, 13s cooling, 1 s between images
20241120 - 0006:   15 images, full frame, 13s cooling, 1 s between images - let's make the cooling curves deeper - we're not quite condensing sharply.  - OAH 1 is quite a bit dirtier, for sure. I wonder if I could perhpaps increase the ref powers somehow.
20241120 - 0015:   Sharper cooling curves - dissapears much faster, maybe the curves are too steep. this was minimum at 2.45 instead of previous 2.55, let's go to 2.50
20241120 - 0021:   Looks very promising - we're cutting and you can see in the end it goes back to thermal cloud actually. Funky. OAH 1 pretty shit.
20241120 - 0025:   Change the min freq to 2.48
20241120 - 0030:   Lemme try again - might have bobbed it with cooling times, and wasn't actually cooling for more than 20 secs - nice, now cooling as we thought we would
20241120 - 0031:   Noice
20241120 - 0032:   pretty noice - go to ODT - oah 1 still kinda shit
20241120 - 0033:   in odt, single shots - empty
20241120 - 0035:   empty
20241120 - 0036:   empty. try less cooling in ODT.
20241120 - 0043:   Empty.
20241120 - 0054:   empty
20241120 - 0058:   Still empty. Might be worth going to absorption, but I fear it's just the same, empty thing
20241120 - 0059:   Still empty. Maybe I need more frequency? Or different offset?
20241120 - 0060:   fucker
20241120 - 0064:   Back to top imaging - Opa forgot the reference beams - makes an interesting plots though.
20241120 - 0065:   Noice. Let's see where we're hitting it with the ODT
20241120 - 0066:   Back to top imaging
20241120 - 0067:   Crap
20241120 - 0068:   weirdly all empty - if we were just missing it I guess we'd see nothing, right? Something is off ...
20241120 - 0069:   maybe I should shake the laser? also keeping the MT on the whole time except for tof. ODT is on for the tof
20241120 - 0072:   Missing it all?
20241120 - 0075:   No laser boy. Lemme go check what's up
20241120 - 0076:   fucking getting nothig
20241120 - 0077:   nothng here
20241120 - 0083:   There we go, we have it. But looks hella tiny, not impressed, kinda scarred what we'd be able to see in OAH. Check the overlap with no MT tof, then go to OAH and hopefully get something useful
20241120 - 0086:   Looks spectacularly shit
20241120 - 0087:   So faint, basically no atoms. Change the offset to something larger, go from 0.6 to 0.8
20241120 - 0090:   Better, for sure, go to 0.9
20241120 - 0091:   Maybe let's also give it some tof - wait why is this worse again (oh could be that I already changed it from 0.8 to 0.9 for this)
20241120 - 0092:   Okay, let's go with some tof
20241120 - 0094:   hard to say, we need less tof
20241120 - 0096:   0.9 hm okay, not shabby. Go to 1.3 V offset, this is at 0.9
20241120 - 0097:   1.3 offset Looks better? go to 3.5
20241120 - 0098:   3.5 empty here, at 3.5. Go to 2.0
20241120 - 0099:   2.0 - There, but much worse - go to 0.6
20241120 - 0100:   0.6 Opa. One of the best - go to 0.3
20241120 - 0101:   0.3 - Too much, go to 0.7
20241120 - 0102:   0.7 - looks good. Let's cool to condensed, first try cool to 3V, then to 2
20241120 - 0103:   why so wavy haha do we have time crystals again - more tof
20241120 - 0104:   bit more tof. But doesn't look too shabby
20241120 - 0105:   Interesting, now let's cool more. If we're lucky we might be able to squeeze out a few OAH images, but we gotta act quickly, we're without LN. Go to 1.5 V cooling
20241120 - 0106:   Better and better, as in more and more condensed
20241120 - 0107:   Nice, we have condensate. Cehck at 0.8, otherwise keep here and go to OAH
20241120 - 0108:   Oh sexy, even better.Keep it here, let's go OAH
20241120 - 0110:   Sexy
20241120 - 0111:   Sexy, it's there, should be good enough to compare. Let;s take one more, then go to a couple of loops
20241120 - 0112:   Next, loop over cooling, same as before. 15 images, 50ms inbetween each image, so 750 ms of cooling captured. At the end we should be at the same depth as the previous three shots - Also seems to have moved, although the conditions are the same
20241120 - 0113:   Only here for a single frame. I should check what happens to the trap, I don't think I release it. Fuck yeah I did, stupid idiot
20241121 - 0002:   empty for some reason? I have a MOT though
20241121 - 0005:   all empty.
20241121 - 0007:   Maybe found the problem? Some of the MOT Switch were suddenly switched off, suuuper weird. I guess it's the whole laggy shit with the NM
20241121 - 0009:   empty to hell with you - reoaded a whole different script
20241121 - 0012:   Yeah this shit empty. Whyyyyy
20241121 - 0013:   yeah, no current through the MT coils.
20241122 - 0000:   nice, we have a cloud in the MT, nice thermal cloud in OAH - can also fit it seems
20241122 - 0001:   go to more cooling
20241122 - 0010:   Lasers unlocked, had to fix - in general, big problems with the lasers.
20241122 - 0011:   nice, nice and kinda starting to resemble something condensed. The edges are still a bit iffy when it comes to reconstruction, not sure why. Perhaps it would be wise to make sure the intensity is centered on the camera. Perhaps not enough laser power
20241122 - 0012:   Pretty - try more cooling, get a condensate - then into the ODT.
20241122 - 0022:   Fuck sake, lost the laser again.
20241122 - 0031:   Not super big, but does the job. Like another thing I know. Could be a cooling thing - let's go to ODT.
20241122 - 0033:   Noice. go to odt
20241122 - 0035:   Ohhh lovely, this looks pretty good, especially OAH2. It's thermal, but looking good my love - Let's image through the cooling (do we want to cut the frame to make it faster?) Let's do something like 300px wide. To still get enough of information.
20241122 - 0037:   !! Really lovely, looks promising. Let's take more images (both beams looking good here) - this is with the smaller frame of 300px.
20241122 - 0038:   !!! OAH1 phase is all over the place. OAH 2 looks lovely, but it seems to slush back and forth. Keep in mind, the time between the shots is 40ms+25us. Let's do now the same but with cooling.
20241122 - 0039:   Let's do next with cooling - 50ms of ODT cooling, then imaging every 50 ms, 25 frames - should cover the whole cooling process. It does seem to slosh about
20241122 - 0040:   empty. Too much cooling, do we start too high? Hm, odd. Let's go to 3V cooling depth.
20241122 - 0041:   Also empty. Still the phase of the first one is horrible. I should make sure to also take a full frame one as well, just to make sure we get nice phase. Might take longer to process, but oh well
20241122 - 0042:   Still empty, from the begining. Go harsher. Also, actually, let's check we're driving the cooling externally. I mean actually we  have to, otherwise we'd see this all the time.
20241122 - 0044:   ALright alright, we have it here, very faint though. Doesn't seem like it's cooling though, right? OAH 1 looks splendind
20241122 - 0045:   !!! Fabulous!! Hard to say where the condensation point is. Cool deeper, maybe we're not even reaching it.
20241122 - 0046:   !! It seems to decrease over time, almost lose it at the end.
20241122 - 0047:   !! This looks better - we seem to 'cool-off' the thermal wings on the side. This looks quite good, not gonna lie, definetly analyse this.
20241122 - 0048:   !!! Let's keep collecting here, also lowering the cooling depth to 0.7. Another epic one, might be the best one of the bunch. Except for the phase of OAH 1. Let's go full frame.
20241122 - 0049:   Maybe cooling too much? Yeah, faint in the begining, then messed up.
20241122 - 0050:   !! Oh maybe not too much cooling, this looks amazing!!
20241122 - 0051:   !!! This is back to full frame, proceed with caution - will take years to analyse, 25 frames.
20241122 - 0052:   !!! Full frame - seems to be here
20241122 - 0053:   Full frame at lower cooling, does not look convincing in viewer, might be worth analysing nonetheless.
20241122 - 0054:   !!! Run what Peter asked us to do - this one in 300 px width - basically 61s of cooling, then 25 frames while cooling, and 1 second inbetween the frames.
20241122 - 0055:   !!! It is nicely within the frame. Looks very nice, let's take more images - the phase of the other one seems funky, let's also take a full frame one at the end.
20241122 - 0056:   !!  50 frames - which means cooling within the first 28, then basically 20 more with just keeping it there.  Okay, not too shabby, not too good either - 50 frames, but we definietly start losing it after we're done cooling.
20241122 - 0057:   !!
20241122 - 0058:   Small frame
20241122 - 0059:   Full Frame
20241122 - 0060:   Full Frame
20241122 - 0061:   back to odt, 50 frames, 300px
20241122 - 0064:   Very faint
20241126 - 0017:   This looks very clean, after a quick OAH reconstruction
20241127 - 0009:   This data looks CLEAN. OAH 1 seems to be even a bit clearer, perhaps slightly more power there.
20241127 - 0010:   Let's take the same loop as we did last time - repeat the imaging for Peter - but check how the thermal cloud moves up and down when switching between the oah1 and 2.
20241127 - 0012:   10x - 500ms
20241127 - 0013:   10x - 500 ms
20241127 - 0014:   What Peter asked - repeat, let's take a few - don't bother analysing here, will take years 50 images, 500ms between, full frame
20241127 - 0015:   .
20241127 - 0016:   .
20241127 - 0017:   Back to single shots
20241127 - 0018:   Single
20241127 - 0019:   Single
20241127 - 0020:   Single - Let's perhaps take a bunch of frames of just the thermal cloud, without further cooling.
20241127 - 0021:   Single - go back to 50 full frame images, with only 61 s cooling - 50 ms inbetween the shots
20241127 - 0022:   One more like that
20241127 - 0023:   One more, just in case. Also, let's go to ODT after, and check how well the OAH works there.
20241127 - 0024:   One more, just in case. Also, let's go to ODT after, and check how well the OAH works there.
20241127 - 0025:   FOR DANIEL - 200 reference images
20241127 - 0026:   FOR DANIEL - 200 reference images - go to ODT
20241127 - 0027:   Uf lots of motion - also it seems to dissapear
20241127 - 0036:   quite faint, lets cool less
20241127 - 0041:   try no cooling - this is very faint, barely anything
20241127 - 0042:   still trash
20241127 - 0043:   Oh maybe too much cooling in the MT?
20241127 - 0061:   gooood
20241127 - 0062:   what Peter wanted, but one beam only - should be quad 2
20241127 - 0063:   what Peter wanted, but one beam only.
20241127 - 0064:   what Peter wanted, but the other beam only - quad 1
20241127 - 0065:   what Peter wanted, but the other beam only.
20241127 - 0066:   Same as before, but with all the power dumped into the beam quad 1
20241127 - 0067:   Same as before, but with all the power dumped into the beam quad 2
20241129 - 0008:   I think I need more power in the OAH beams. Let's go optimize even more. Or perhaps much more in the probe? That should work as well, right? And just sacrifice the destructivness a bit
20241129 - 0012:   hm, no higher order peaks, for some reason - might be camera issues
20241129 - 0013:   okay, looks clean - let's repeat the Peter's measurement
20241129 - 0015:   loooop
20241129 - 0019:   5 images only, spaced 5 s.
20241129 - 0033:   realigned again, should be more in line now.
20241129 - 0034:   50
20241129 - 0035:   50
20241129 - 0036:   50
20241129 - 0037:   back to singlr
20241129 - 0040:   back to single
20241202 - 0005:   lol every second one is empty, isn't that fun
20241202 - 0006:   no tof really, MT still on
20241202 - 0007:   at 60 secs cooling
20241202 - 0008:   Also, no nitrogen yet
20241202 - 0037:   run a lit
20241202 - 0049:   what the fuck is going on, this is strange, mallfunctioned?
20241202 - 0050:   empty
20241204 - 0011:   On resonance, massive issues with unwrapping. OAH 2 trash as it gets, but the condensate still there. Go to detuned version, and ramp up the probe power to 200 uW
20241204 - 0012:   Woah, this aliasing is mental, but so is the noise, it does not get better, interestingly. What is going on here, looks like there was no RF 2 cooling for some reason.
20241204 - 0013:   now cooling. But still noisy at the edges.
20241204 - 0014:   Ugh, each noisy on one side. but the plane looks clean. let me take them with each beam individually as well.
20241204 - 0016:   OAH 1 only - looks good
20241204 - 0017:   OAh 1 only. Swap to the other one.
20241204 - 0018:   OAH 2 only - seems cleaner though than with the combined, interesting - still that annoying interferene iris pattern next to it
20241204 - 0019:   OAH 2, cleanish
20241204 - 0020:   Perhaps slightly better. Let's take the loop at 200 uW probe, then go even lower.
20241204 - 0021:   don't analyse the next one
20241204 - 0022:   Peter's runs (200 uW)
20241204 - 0023:   Peter's runs (200 uW)
20241204 - 0024:   Peter's runs (400 uW)
20241204 - 0025:   Peter's runs (400 uW) - fml forgot to keep the MT on for the entire time, should be empty after first image - redo this
20241204 - 0026:   Same as last one, with 50 flat images as well. Should be enough I reckon - next same, but we will also decompress while cooling. Should be funky
20241204 - 0027:   with decompression. Let's take 5 images only or something, to make it possible to preview here.
20241204 - 0041:   Peters run (400 uW) - this time proper, with 50 flat images as well - they have that weird feature, the interference ughgghghh
20241204 - 0042:   Peters run (400 uW) - this time proper, with 50 flat images as well
20241204 - 0043:   Peters run (400 uW) - this time proper, with 50 flat images as well
20241204 - 0044:   THis thing in the middleee ughh. Also, dissapears relatively quickly. Let's do just decompression, no cooling at the time - OAH 1 seem fine though
20241204 - 0045:   lose it immediatelly - decomp too sharp?
20241204 - 0048:   disapears after one shot
20241204 - 0051:   Still works. Lets ramp the probe to absurd values
20241204 - 0052:   Hm. let's go the other extreme - this is awful.
20241204 - 0053:   xxx empty
20241204 - 0054:   Peter's run (900 uW) - with 50 flat
20241204 - 0055:   Peter's run ( 20 uW) - with 50 flat
20241204 - 0056:   second one is trash, 20 us
20241204 - 0058:   oah 2 trash
20241204 - 0059:   eh, I guess - not looking too too bad. Let's wait for the oven, then run the list
20241204 - 0066:   looks decent, let's try the 50.
20241204 - 0067:   multi, with displaced oah beams
20241206 - 0028:   go to ODT
20241206 - 0030:   go fuck yourself big time
20241206 - 0031:   I hate my lasers so much, with so much passion.
20241206 - 0032:   I can't work like this.
20241206 - 0036:   OKay, now really to ODT, I hopeee
20241206 - 0039:   oh lekker
20241206 - 0041:   ODT Expansion with thermal atoms
20241206 - 0055:   gone, or lasers fucked up?
20241206 - 0056:   try condensing.
20241206 - 0057:   Maybe too muhc cooling?
20241206 - 0060:   Feels like not enough cooling - seems very thermal - go deeper, and let's also go slower? And after that faster
20241206 - 0062:   Faint. Try faster cooling.
20241206 - 0063:   go to 550 ms cooling time
20241206 - 0064:   maybe looks better? Go even faster?
20241206 - 0066:   hm, seems worse? Maybe still not cooling deep enough
20241206 - 0079:   Oh okay, this looks nice and promising - is it just much faster IR ramp? Try that
20241206 - 0080:   Oh mama where did you come from now? What have I changed, nothing I think? This is ramp time back at 1 s
20241206 - 0081:   I mean even with slower ramp still works. Try more tof, then go do the list. Why thouhg, it just happend to get better after I paused for a while. This is with 1250 ms cooling until 0.8 V coolingdepth
20241206 - 0082:   Oh mama yes. Nice, let's run the list.
20241206 - 0083:   List tof in odt
20241206 - 0088:   Looks better
20241206 - 0094:   gone, uh oh
20241206 - 0095:   strange - all is locked, gotta be the AOM maybe? no strange, everything seems okay
20241206 - 0096:   hij is terug
20241206 - 0109:   looks like a decent expansion.
20241206 - 0114:   Let's see if we can make spinor condensates :o
20241206 - 0115:   uhm not nice - tried with some spinflipping(but not really) and SG
20241206 - 0116:   Opa definetely split up, pulled apart. Which is strange, because I haven't applied any spin flipping, so it's just on its onw? How aobut the conservation laws? I taught it was impossible. Anyway, try without the spinflpping channel altogether
20241206 - 0117:   Quite funky. Where are the other atoms from? Try less tof, should have I kept the finetune on? Probably right, otherwise what's my basis lol
20241206 - 0119:   Also my finetune coils are still on. Shall I just go do the spinflpping as well, see if it still works as I remeber.
20241206 - 0120:   sad. try no sg
20241206 - 0121:   what the hell, back to this bullshit? Why, it should be the same as the tof runs. Try without FT on during the cooling stage - oh, also try to turn off the MOT coils with their switch
20241206 - 0122:   Interesting, try without the MOT coils (which should be at zero anyway, but maybe it's not?) Otherwise, what the hell is going one. Oh maybe the spinflipping, but that channel should be off anyway. Ugh, haven't changed anything else (there does seem to be some pull of the cloud to the left).
20241206 - 0123:   Yep, definetely that. This looks just as amazing as before. So it was the MOT coils on, interesting. Let's not do SG, but only turn the channel on for the SG, to avoid all the destructive action we seem to get if it's applied before.
20241206 - 0124:   Oh sexyyy we go splitting. But there should be no spinflipping going on, unless the quantization axis is off anyway. So should be all okay if we keep the FT coils on? Try it first without SG to see if keeping that on makes a difference? Also, should I try more SG, this is at 0.01 or something. Check how it is at higher, it used to be 0.25.
20241206 - 0125:   !! yeah beuty, we got SG splitting. Back to 10 ms tof, and higher SG current next (compare it with the previous one)b
20241206 - 0126:   !! hard to judge, seems a bit different tho, try again
20241206 - 0127:   basically the same splitting, just brighter. try more tof, then with some spinpull as well. Let's make them domains. Oh also then with then FT on. Because now I had xcomp on, which should be perpendicular to the FT, which could explain this? - it does seem 50/50
20241206 - 0128:   !!! Lovelyy. So if I get this correctly, keeping the finetune on, which is the quantization axis, should give me a single component only - oh sorry, the xcomp is still on, but I believe it should be overpowered by the fintune. Let's see
20241206 - 0129:   !!! Yesss, as expected. I'm smartttt. Let's do some spinpull in the ODT first, let's hope we don't mess it up fully.
20241206 - 0130:   Let's pull on it for 25 ms, with amp of 0.01, whch I think should be enough. Keep in mind, afterwards we'll turn off the MOT switch, and then turn it back on for the SG. Another note, spinpull before cooling
20241206 - 0131:   Not enough maybe? Nice splitting thouhg, try more SG power, maybe we need more because we're in the ODT
20241206 - 0132:   lvoely, seems like most of the atoms are now pulled - could be the problem with the quantization axis now. Try with proper spinflipping now, hopefully it works. But looks promising.
20241206 - 0133:   if anyting I made it worse. Fine, let's go without the xcomp, and rather go with finetune only. Should be splitting along z axis though
20241206 - 0134:   interesting, most of them in the same state. Try disabling xcomp, rather have bias in finetune (z) so we should see splitting in the z direction. But, since that is also the quantization axis, we should see something fun, should be splitting. I also want to see how good this is in OAH, in situ
20241206 - 0135:   lovely, seems kinda 50/50. Let's go back to xcomp, and have some more spinpull time. Also, maybe bring the xcomp high earlier on?
20241206 - 0136:   Feels like the more magnetic fields we have, the more it gets messed up. Maybe longer at lower powers? Keep now the quantization axis in x.
20241206 - 0137:   just try no spinpull. Then maybe go try nothing, and just go to OAH, raw condensate in ODT, see where we are in terms of resolution. Don't have high hopes though, because the in situ image looks thinnnn
20241206 - 0138:   !! sexy. xcomp on since I turn off the MT. Idk, one more then OAH.
20241206 - 0139:   see if it's the time of spinpull or the amp that kills us. First, lower the amp to 0.1, keep at 50 ms. Next at 1.5 for 10 ms. Could definetely put it together.
20241206 - 0140:   This looks damaging - let's keep the time low.
20241206 - 0141:   Mjah. Kinda same. try one more, at 1V for 5 ms. Then really go to OAH.
20241206 - 0142:   !! lovely, perhaps better. Go to neutral - no spinflip, no spinpull, no SG - then OAH
20241206 - 0143:   not shabby, but still very stripy, which makes me believe that could be trapped induced? get rid of xcomp, then for real OAH, like for real, going to the lab now.
20241206 - 0144:   little bit faint, which can be explained with lower powers of the F=1. Probe was at 45 instead of 70, where I left it.
20241206 - 0145:   God this is thin and tiny
20241206 - 0146:   The background phase kinda seems okay, but devistatingly thin. I wonder if tof of 1 ms would help? Or if we immediatelly lose all the density contrast. Are we detuned, or is unwrapping silly? Ugh, not fun at all. let's indeed try tof of 1, just for lols.
20241206 - 0147:   Also, maybe try more tlight? Also just for fun. Next one the same, but more tlight
20241206 - 0148:   !! Hm, perhaps we might need to do some refocusing. try more light
20241206 - 0149:   !! perhaps slightly better indeed? Let's try even more, go to 200 us. And also notice that the middle seems very dense, could be problems with unwrapping, or we're really that dense.
20241206 - 0150:   !!! very nice, at least both beams give decent reconstruction. But like 2 px wide, so eh
20241206 - 0151:   OAh 1 seems better, but not OAH 2. Go to 500, idk, let's go
20241206 - 0152:   at 500 us t_light - quite incredible, I wonder how destructive. Let's go to the thin version, but this looks promising - go to 1000us light :o for funnn. Then 1 ms tof
20241206 - 0153:   Uiii 1000 us probe light seems too much, we're saturating, counting like 70k on pixel values
20241206 - 0154:   1 ms tof, pretty much disapears, but still there, just about. go back to in situ.
20241206 - 0155:   did the same, by accident - indicently, looks way better, lol. Perhaps could see something, but doubt it will be very useful.
20241206 - 0156:   Perhaps also little bit too much for the camera? We can lower the exposure time, which we do for a smaller frame.  Go to 300px next. Still thin, but the SNR seems quite higher.
20241206 - 0157:   I mean this looks lovely - a bit of issues, perhaps we are still a bit over exposed. Try going to 400us. Then check what the difference is in descructiveness.
20241206 - 0158:   Decent
20241206 - 0159:   !! looks very nice actually. Maybe I am tripping, but it seems shifted here as well. Which checks out I guess.
20241206 - 0160:   !! little white fainter region in the middle, pulse issues perhaps?
20241206 - 0161:   !! nice. But again, about 4 px wide. I want to try shaking the trap, but let's rather collect some multi image shots
20241206 - 0162:   Uh even more issues here with the pulses. Did I change something? But nonetheless, good contrast with the condensate. Perhaps I need to change the pulses if I change the imaging time to like half a ms.
20241206 - 0163:   Oh right, forgot that I turned off the ODT. Should we adjust the pulses? I guess we need to make it a little bit longer? - try 1.75ms instead of 1.35
20241206 - 0165:   Wrong way with the pulses.
20241206 - 0166:   messed up pulses
20241206 - 0167:   Seems quite destructive, not gonna lie. Let's do the same with 5 ms between the shots. It's still a bit weird in the middle with that line, my pulses are slightly off I thin, but not sure how to fix it. I mean also, it could just be that it doesn't survive 50 seconds haha. Because there is half a second inbetween the shots
20241206 - 0168:   This is 5 ms between the shots - better, I think, for sure. There is motion - less destructive, but still destructive. Do the same for 300 us, 200 us, 100us, 50 and 20 us - to cehck for destructiveness.
20241206 - 0173:   
20241206 - 0175:   Back to full plot, 50 images, 500 ms in between, through cooling, only thermal cloud - at 25 us imaging time - but probably the RF curves are defined so they don't end, but just go once activated. Let's check at 60 second cooling. Or change the curves
20241206 - 0176:   COOLIng and at 400 us. Now the same with a condensate
20241206 - 0177:   at condensed, should be
20241206 - 0178:   Only RF1
20241206 - 0179:   Only RF1
20241211 - 0001:   perhaps too much illumination time - messes it up a bit
20241211 - 0017:   Lovely, might be misfocused? Also, let's try shaking the trap now. Let's make a thick boy - then just go with some spinpulling?
20241211 - 0026:   change the freq of odt scan to 10khz
20241211 - 0027:   10khz odt, still gives us a nice trap. Hard to say if it's larger. Oh, the amplitude is probably too small. Let's rampt that up a bnit as well
20241211 - 0028:   empty
20241211 - 0030:   faint, there, but dissapearing
20241211 - 0031:   at 0.05 V amplitude it becomes a bit more apparent.
20241211 - 0033:   yea get it back at zero, go to 0.01
20241211 - 0035:   let's try higher amplitude, but less cooling - this is at 0.8 V of cooling
20241211 - 0037:   Helps. try even less cooling
20241211 - 0038:   Next one with less cooling
20241211 - 0051:   ohh way thicker - is it just trhermal
20241211 - 0052:   check at no amplitude
20241211 - 0054:   Too much amplitude (0.8) - Also, seeems like 0.0024 is optimal focus
20241211 - 0055:   two side lines, interesting
20241211 - 0059:   Still two lines, this at 0.3
20241211 - 0060:   0.2 - gets closer Buit interesting that we can still see it in OAH
20241211 - 0061:   Interesting. We need to somehow manage the amplitude. Let me try without any cooling.
20241211 - 0065:   Interesting - I do need an amplitude fluctuation as well - this is without cooling
20241211 - 0067:   Cool, at 0.1 looks like a single line. Go to 0.15
20241211 - 0068:   at 0.15. Faint signs of two lines.Let's try cooling now here. How do we fix this to make it a single profile. Or maybe less frequency? Freq to 10k, at 0.2
20241211 - 0069:   Also try higher frequency of like 200k
20241211 - 0070:   Oh funky, cares less about the amplitude at higher frequencies. Try more amp her
20241211 - 0071:   0.5 V amplitude - Maybe maybe, looks better? Let me try even more amplitude, and then perhaps some cooling
20241211 - 0072:   Too much, resembles the previous images - try less, maybe 0.7
20241211 - 0073:   wider, but still kinda doubled go to 0.6
20241211 - 0075:   Try cooling here, I kinda like this. 200kHz at 0.5 V amplitude, and 700mV of offset - no phase.
20241211 - 0076:   Start with cooling down to 4
20241211 - 0077:   Go to 2
20241211 - 0079:   Hm, its just disapearing - more cooling
20241211 - 0080:   4.5 accidentaly
20241211 - 0083:   no cooling, but the contrast seems quite okay still, even in the OAH setup. I like
20241211 - 0084:   try some spinflipping, see if we can make little contrasty parts.
20241211 - 0091:   This all seems too destructive
20241211 - 0093:   Try less spinpulling
20241211 - 0094:   
20241211 - 0095:   try without the second spinpull
20241211 - 0097:   Don't see any splitting
20241211 - 0106:   Lost the lasers
20241211 - 0112:   Noice
20241211 - 0113:   Wider. 0.7
20241211 - 0114:   0.5 NIcee. Try some spinpul
20241211 - 0118:   Looking good, let's go to small frames - try taking a bunch of images - then let's make movies and check what we see. If anything is happening (also while we're applying the magnetic force)
20241211 - 0119:   Go with the loop. I.m a bit annoyed with the whole iris concentric circles thingy in the middle.
20241211 - 0122:   doesnt seem to have any motion, on short timescale of 10s ms.
20241211 - 0123:   mmkay, looks alright. There's the annoying line in the middle which I don't particularly like, has to do with pulses and long exposure time. Let's go to 10 ms between the frames, to see if there's any motion within the trap on longer time scales.
20241211 - 0124:   Yep, motoin on this scale for sure. Let's try applying some spin force during the imaging. Would be interesting.
20241211 - 0126:   Okay, tried no spin-dependent force, seems to stay put, no motion. Try 0.95 pulse to see if we get rid of that line in the middle. Try 0.87 pulse pretrig
20241211 - 0127:   seems to periodcally become bigger and smaller, the line in the middle. Thgis is with spinpull
20241211 - 0128:   Pretty much perfect in terms of pulses.
20241211 - 0129:   maybe a tad bit more
20241211 - 0130:   Try a tiny bit less pulse time. Then blast it more with the MOT?
20241211 - 0132:   YEah, perrfect pulses
20241211 - 0135:   It get;s wrecked quite quickly - try less probeshut, maybe we also start loosing it there
20241216 - 0001:   Looks lovely, go to ODT
20241216 - 0004:   go to ODT here
20241216 - 0007:   Oh lovely - these look quite nice, let's go to multi
20241216 - 0020:   Looking amazing, go to smaller frame. Is this condesned?
20241216 - 0021:   will analyse all of those I guess
20241216 - 0030:   enabled spinpuill
20241216 - 0047:   Nice. Try next some with cooling
20241216 - 0048:   Much fainter
20241216 - 0053:   Try to reproduce the famous 350 shot - make sure to match the spinflipping parameters as well
20241216 - 0054:   changed the sweep to 60ms sweep time.
20241216 - 0055:   Woah really really faint but you can just see if shooting left and right. Go to  5/1 spinpull time/amp. Also this is with finetune not gently brought down, let's also do that
20241216 - 0056:   more or less empty (super faint, but yeah, empty.
20241216 - 0057:   Try with no spinpull durig tof - because it for sure pulls it there (but then why wouldnt it pull the same way during the spinpull stage, let's be honest, there's no difference between the two, or should be at least.
20241216 - 0058:   faint, but less motion - little bit stil, let's do spinpull, but lower amplitude (0.1)
20241216 - 0059:   0.1 doesn't seem to do much, go to 0.5 - let's find the sweetspot
20241216 - 0060:   Let's try putting a bit more power in OAH 2
20241216 - 0061:   Try going to more t_light, and lower tof_sg
20241216 - 0062:   not too fantastic, ngl. Could do with more probe power I guess? Or reference power as well - go to t_light 400
20241216 - 0063:   not better - are my condensates just smaller? Ugh. Try the same but no cooling - might be also worth realigning, the little interference thing is right in the middle of the condensate. Not ideal
20241216 - 0064:   Higher t_light messes up the pulses a bit more. It doesnt seem to be worth it, also. back to 200
20241216 - 0065:   Looking good. Because it's not condensed - oah 2 absolute trashhh
20241216 - 0069:   Nice lil oscillation - but seems like one spin component only. perhaps it would be good to go to absorption and make sure we have any condensed spin flipping working.
20241216 - 0070:   Just give it spinpull, nothing during the tof stage. Just to pull the spins apart.
20241216 - 0071:   go to absorption and make sure what we have.
20241216 - 0072:   interesting, seems like we are not quite fully condensed.
20241216 - 0073:   Go lower with cooling. To 1.2 - also seems like no splitting, no shifting.
20241216 - 0074:   Also that interference patter right fucking there
20241216 - 0075:   More cooled - starting to lose it
20241216 - 0076:   try slower cooling? go to 2250 ms
20241216 - 0077:   fucking hell honestly, what is that massive thing in the middle. Where does it come from?
20241216 - 0079:   Maybe a bit better? Go to more tof, then play with cooling times, maybe even run a list - perhaps no splitting
20241216 - 0080:   Ugh this thing again, big squeeze. So funky. Try no SG
20241216 - 0087:   let's run a list.
20241216 - 0091:   this is all trash, where are all my particles - maybe lasers need to be realigned?
20241216 - 0098:   This is all more or less horrible, not gonna lie
20241216 - 0105:   yea absolutley trash at 60s
20241216 - 0106:   try at lower t_light, in the past that helped
20241216 - 0107:   yeah, indeed helps. Not a bad particle number, for what I thought - maybe we need to lower the t_light for the ODT condensates as well
20241216 - 0112:   still trashhhhh - maybe the whole cooling is shit?
20241216 - 0117:   Absolute trash, nothing here at all. Try way less cooling
20241216 - 0119:   So badddd what the helllll - go to even higher? But that's further from the condensate.
20241216 - 0121:   So bad
20241216 - 0122:   Try again without the ODT cooling
20241216 - 0124:   fucking bullshit. Nothing here.
20241216 - 0125:   idk, gotta be the too high cooling depth. Go lower. Make condensates. Find the transition point.
20241216 - 0127:   even worse. Maybe cool more? Go to 0.7
20241216 - 0128:   too muhc cooling?
20241216 - 0129:   mmkay, something condensed apperaring
20241216 - 0130:   and gone.
20241216 - 0131:   Ugh. Check again at 60 seconds. If we're still at 200+ M I'll lose my shit
20241216 - 0132:   FUCK ME
20241218 - 0019:   clmibing up that particle number. Might not be a bad idea to optimize the zeeman power, although not sure how wort it. See where this leaves us.
20241218 - 0045:   Still raising, but look at this odd fluctuation. In another life/another phd project this should be looked at, for sure
20241218 - 0069:   i mean dod the laser kove?
20241218 - 0070:   kinda okayish, but ugh so small and tiny and nothing. maybe the laser scanming settings are off
20241218 - 0080:   list of cooling depths
20241218 - 0102:   Go with Peter's shots. First one is kinda messed up, but alright. next one with 50 images, careful with analysis.
20241218 - 0103:   50 images - 200us probe - through cooling - full frame - 500ms between frames - original
20241218 - 0104:   50 images - 200us probe - through cooling - full frame - 500ms between frames - original
20241218 - 0105:   50 images - 200us probe - through cooling - full frame - 500ms between frames (minimal ref cross talk) - looks dirtryy
20241218 - 0106:   50 images - 200us probe - through cooling - full frame - 500ms between frames (minimal ref cross talk) - looks dirtryy
20241218 - 0107:   50 images - 200us probe - through cooling - full frame - 500ms between frames (maximal ref cross talk - should be same polarizatino )
20241218 - 0108:   50 images - 200us probe - through cooling - full frame - 500ms between frames (maximal ref cross talk - should be same polarizatino )
20241218 - 0109:   50 images - 200us probe - through cooling - full frame - 500ms between frames (maximal ref cross talk - should be same polarizatino ) - why did the inter term move?
20241218 - 0110:   50 images - 200us probe - through cooling - full frame - 500ms between frames - moved the beams massively one direction
20241218 - 0111:   50 images - 200us probe - through cooling - full frame - 500ms between frames - moved the beams massively one direction
20241218 - 0112:   50 images - 200us probe - through cooling - full frame - 500ms between frames - moved the beams massively the other direction
20241218 - 0113:   50 images - 200us probe - through cooling - full frame - 500ms between frames - moved the beams massively the other direction
20241218 - 0114:   50 images - 200us probe - through cooling - full frame - 500ms between frames - compressed the peaks towards the centre
20241218 - 0115:   50 images - 200us probe - through cooling - full frame - 500ms between frames - compressed the peaks towards the centre
20241218 - 0116:   even more
20241218 - 0117:   even more
20241218 - 0118:   And far the other way
20241218 - 0119:   And far the other way
20241218 - 0120:   And far the other way
20241218 - 0121:   back to home
20241218 - 0122:   back to home
20241218 - 0123:   // and everything the same, but just background - the k4 switch closed
20241218 - 0124:   // and everything the same, but just background - the k4 switch closed
20250108 - 0001:   okay image, but empty - but we have MOT
20250108 - 0016:   something funky was going on with the MOT coils during the MT stages
20250108 - 0034:   big fuckery
20250108 - 0035:   okay, it's here, let's see at 60. the problem was with Zeeman Repumper AOM signal, got corrupted again, same as (was it) the MOT repumper AOM
20250108 - 0039:   fuck me, what the hell is going on with the server, the camera crashes "probably due to buffer underrun"
20250108 - 0045:   okay, things calmed down a bit - let's go to 5s cooling and check how our zeeman power is doing, and if we can improve this baby
20250108 - 0048:   no tof seems to funks it up a bit
20250108 - 0049:   oh that was still with tof, or?
20250108 - 0052:   okay, let it stabilize, then go twindle with the buttons
20250108 - 0056:   off and on, appears and dissapears, whyy
20250108 - 0065:   it is every second
20250108 - 0069:   empty
20250108 - 0071:   empty
20250108 - 0072:   
20250108 - 0074:   empty
20250108 - 0075:   how is that even possible
20250108 - 0076:   two in a row???!!!?? cuold it be?
20250108 - 0077:   empty
20250108 - 0080:   empty
20250108 - 0087:   try with non-zero tof param, but MT on the whole time
20250108 - 0123:   it seems like there is a faint line in the midde - so maybe there's something else at play here?
20250108 - 0154:   mm okay okay, seems to be something in it, I prolonged the time of the MOT idle t o10 s
20250108 - 0160:   seems like 1 sec is too little, go to 5.
20250108 - 0165:   seems like every second one is smaller?
20250108 - 0197:   maybe wrong way? went CW a bit
20250108 - 0235:   okay, let's leave it here.
20250110 - 0001:   fuck, empty. Go to 5 seconds cooling. All empty still, but everything should be on .
20250110 - 0031:   fuck, empty. Go to 5 seconds cooling. All empty still, but everything should be on .
20250110 - 0033:   fuck, same as yesterday - one of the channels stopped working, (MOT Rep Shutter), so had to rewire
20250110 - 0034:   but ok
20250110 - 0035:   what the fuck empty again?
20250110 - 0036:   We're aliveeeee
20250110 - 0037:   check the cooling to to condensation, also might be useful for simulations
20250110 - 0042:   That's all the same, are we not cooling through?
20250110 - 0043:   yeah, was capped at 20s cooling
20250110 - 0050:   still no condensing. Lower the curves, make sure we get condensates
20250110 - 0052:   !! Wopppa my boyyyy oh so hot. And by hot I mean cold. Let's see how far this gets us
20250110 - 0053:   amazing. Had to lower the cooling curves a bit. Let's see if this gets us to 29 seconds also. Then OAH
20250110 - 0072:   might be a good idea to move the interference patter away as well
20250110 - 0095:   try a cheeky loop of 5 images, to see how it looks like.
20250110 - 0097:   all loops
20250110 - 0098:   but no cooling?
20250110 - 0102:   50 images - but it doesn't seem like we're cooling at all - oooh I misdeifined the RF
20250110 - 0103:   1
20250110 - 0104:   1
20250110 - 0105:   1
20250110 - 0106:   5 frames - 5000 ms
20250110 - 0107:   !! [BASELINE] 25 frames - 1000 ms
20250110 - 0108:   !! [BASELINE] 25 frames - 1000 ms - let's funk up the FFT
20250110 - 0109:   [SHIFT LEFT] 5 frames - 5000 ms, disapears half way throgh
20250110 - 0110:   [SHIFT LEFT] better images, at least partially reliable 5 frames
20250110 - 0111:   !! [SHIFT LEFT] lovely 25 frames - 1000 ms
20250110 - 0112:   !! [SHIFT LEFT] 25 frames - 1000 ms
20250110 - 0113:   !! [SHIFT LEFT] 25 frames - 1000 ms - if it's nice we move on and mess up the other way
20250110 - 0114:   fml, empty - but the frames look clean, so just the matter of condensates
20250110 - 0115:   also empty, interesting
20250110 - 0116:   Also nothing in the interference pattern - ugh moved one of the mirrors when changing the ref beams. Try again, I quickly put it back, fingers crossed iss decent enough. At least a little, pleeeaseee
20250110 - 0117:   !! [SHIFT RIGHT] Yesss it's back - 25 frames - 1000 ms
20250110 - 0118:   !! [SHIFT RIGHT] 25 frames - 1000 ms
20250110 - 0119:   !! [SHIFT RIGHT] 25 frames - 1000 ms
20250110 - 0120:   !! [SHIFT RIGHT] 25 frames - 1000 ms
20250110 - 0121:   !! [SHIFT UP]  25 frames - 1000 ms
20250110 - 0122:   !! [SHIFT UP]  25 frames - 1000 ms
20250110 - 0123:   !! [SHIFT UP]  25 frames - 1000 ms
20250110 - 0124:   !! [SHIFT DOWN]  25 frames - 1000 ms
20250110 - 0125:   !! [SHIFT DOWN]  25 frames - 1000 ms
20250110 - 0126:   !! [SHIFT DOWN]  25 frames - 1000 ms
20250110 - 0127:   !! [SHIFT DOWNNNNN]  25 frames - 1000 ms
20250110 - 0128:   [SHIFT DOWNNNNN]  25 frames - 1000 ms seems empty, lost the laser lock
20250110 - 0129:   [SHIFT DOWNNNNN]  25 frames - 1000 ms seems empty, lost the laser lock
20250110 - 0130:   [BASELINE] 25 frames - 1000 ms
20250110 - 0131:   [BASELINE] 25 frames - 1000 ms
20250110 - 0132:   [BASELINE] 25 frames - 1000 ms also no nitrogen, so wouldn't be surprised if I lose it
20250110 - 0133:   [BASELINE] 25 frames - 1000 ms
20250114 - 0163:   both refs on
20250114 - 0164:   OAH1 only
20250114 - 0165:   OAH2
20250114 - 0166:   OAH1
20250114 - 0167:   OAH1 @ 100us
20250114 - 0168:   OAH2 @ 100us
20250114 - 0170:   both, looks good. Displaced. let's fuck up the OAH alignment again.
20250114 - 0171:   [DOWN] Still shifteddd - same amount as before
20250114 - 0172:   [DOWN] Still shifteddd - same amount as before. Go the other way.
20250114 - 0173:   [UP] Still shifted, same amount - shift CCW
20250114 - 0174:   [CCW]
20250114 - 0175:   [CCW]
20250114 - 0176:   swapped positions of the peaks - correspondigly, the two clouds swap positions - so it's inherent to the beams somehow.
20250115 - 0006:   kinda low with particles. Ugh. - it is no tof, so could be that. Let's do OAH on resonance
20250115 - 0010:   Let's do OAH on resonance
20250115 - 0014:   Let's after this do a loop over different tofs. Should still give us some density, right
20250115 - 0015:   Do the list
20250115 - 0017:   Practically gone, it seems. This is at 1ms tof
20250115 - 0019:   Woah but the other one is still empty? Damn are we actually looking at polarization erffect? :o
20250115 - 0020:   The hell? Seems the other way now?
20250115 - 0032:   More cooling - almost condensed
20250115 - 0039:   empty
20250115 - 0044:   Now really empty
20250115 - 0049:   Try again at 60- seconds, but more tofs inbetween
20250115 - 0050:   Oh fuck off. It's back lol. But the amplitude seems to jump like hell. Let's try the polarization plate rotation.
20250115 - 0051:   84 original position - 84 degrees
20250115 - 0052:   84 OAH1 below OAH 2
20250115 - 0053:   129 (=84+45) degrees - still OAH1 below OAH2 - but perhaps way brighter?
20250115 - 0054:   129
20250115 - 0055:   174 0 still same
20250115 - 0056:   174 Same as before - go plus 45
20250115 - 0057:   219 - same, but maybe oah1 brighter?
20250115 - 0058:   219 I mean surely OAH 1 brighter now than it was before. Still shifted the same way though
20250115 - 0059:   264 - same up down
20250115 - 0060:   264
20250115 - 0061:   309
20250115 - 0062:   354
20250115 - 0063:   39
20250115 - 0064:   84 - back home go in increments of 22.5 - should mess up the polarization though, so one should be way weaker.
20250115 - 0065:   106.5 - same story
20250115 - 0066:   61.5
20250115 - 0067:   84
20250115 - 0068:   matched polarization - somehow funky
20250115 - 0070:   camera acting out - didn't set up variables properly
20250115 - 0075:   !!!! This is it - they are in the same spot - changed the polarization of one of the reference beams, to match the other. It is an atomic effect, this is exciting.
20250115 - 0076:   this means the atoms do deflect the light - it is purely an effect of atoms, right?
20250115 - 0079:   Which also means it's not a silly thing we're doing
20250115 - 0080:   
20250115 - 0081:   Try shifting to the other beam
20250115 - 0082:   !!! Oh fuck me it works
20250124 - 0022:   go to less rf to optimize
20250124 - 0033:   I don't get it, even with 10 seconds in between, god.
20250124 - 0034:   Go to 50 secs
20250124 - 0037:   Little bit CCW - higher power, let's see if we can up the pnum
20250124 - 0038:   
20250124 - 0039:   seems about the same? Let's turn a bit more
20250124 - 0041:   Ugh fml

20250124 - 0091:   
20250124 - 0092:   let's try ramping up the y comp
20250124 - 0093:   ycomp maxed
20250124 - 0094:   ycomp maxed
20250124 - 0095:   let's max the comp, but then also flip the polarity before the imaging. This should effectively flip the spins and the relative polarizations - so it should flip the displacements in the opposite directions - I just the flipping of the MT will be slow enough that the spins will follwo
20250124 - 0096:   Uf interesting, shifted by quite a bit, but feels like the cloud was just displaced. Try slower turning, then also lower y comp effect, just the opposite side.
20250124 - 0097:   But it's still the same way. the shift that is, OAH2 above OAH1
20250124 - 0098:   next one the ycomp is not changed, but the polarity will be swapped
20250124 - 0099:   [lambda/4 = 54 deg] mm okay, let's try to flip the polarizations by rotating the lambda/4 plate - now, it's at 54 degrees - let's rotate by 45 degrees, should swap, right?
20250124 - 0100:   [lambda/4 = 99 deg] Oh funky, it seems like the OAH 1 is now fully there, and almost nothing in OAH2. Perhaps I'd have to rotate by 94 degrees - now it's mainly interfereing with OAH1
20250124 - 0101:   [lambda/4 = 99 deg] Definetely interesting - i mean in the FFT plane still looks like we have both. Let's go 90 degrees, so from 99 to 144
20250124 - 0102:   [lambda/4 = 99 deg] The OAH is definetely spanning larger portion, over the whole cloud now
20250124 - 0103:   [lambda/4 = 144 deg]
20250124 - 0104:   [lambda/4 = 144 deg] Yepppp the two swapped - OAH1 now above OAH2
20250124 - 0108:   base
20250124 - 0115:   let's give it a lil kick, and start shifting it up and down. still single shots only.
20250124 - 0116:   didn't quite move. More kick?
20250124 - 0122:   try more of a kick even, this is nothing.
20250124 - 0123:   yea in the past kick was to 3
20250124 - 0125:   empty - too much of a kick for a thermal cloud I guess.
20250124 - 0130:   check 2 ms later.
20250124 - 0131:   Interesting shape, but hard to say if it moved a lot.
20250124 - 0132:   2 ms later
20250124 - 0133:   Maybe it has moved a bit. Let's go with a list
20250124 - 0135:   do the list of probeshut
20250124 - 0153:   empty
20250127 - 0004:   why is it empty
20250127 - 0011:   go fuck yourself
20250127 - 0016:   MT was off
20250127 - 0022:   let's see why it breaks after every second run. Try abort then start again immediately
20250127 - 0027:   reliably on and off. Let's see if we can force it to be on if we manually restart - so if it's a time thing or something else
20250127 - 0030:   nope, still empty, even if aborting. let's see what the time should be then
20250127 - 0031:   9 seems to be too litle. Go to 11
20250127 - 0032:   nope
20250127 - 0033:   go to 14
20250127 - 0034:   nope, and there was MOT and MT - I don't get it
20250127 - 0036:   idk, I don't know - let's see if I have 60secs cooling
20250127 - 0037:   let's run it at 60s RF with 1sec MOT Idle
20250127 - 0038:   that works, so the time needed is somewhere not in the MT? or still? Godddd I don't knoww this is bullshit
20250127 - 0039:   particle number low becuae we have no LN
20250127 - 0040:   at 45 rf still works
20250127 - 0041:   yep
20250127 - 0043:   check at 30
20250127 - 0044:   and here it's gone - at 30 secs.
20250127 - 0046:   go check at 35
20250127 - 0054:   nope
20250127 - 0060:   40 is ok
20250128 - 0010:   keep rising baby
20250128 - 0052:   Nice, it's here. let's cool and let expand. then figure out the scanning
20250128 - 0105:   oh come onn
20250128 - 0106:   What the hell is going on, why is my cloud of atoms so small?
20250128 - 0107:   What the hell is goin on? Let's check at 60 seconds cooling.
20250128 - 0108:   my focking god this is small and shit. What's going on?
20250128 - 0110:   Run a list through MOTcurrs
20250128 - 0159:   yea I don't get this bullshit. This is lovely. Changed the repumper a bit
20250128 - 0164:   Play around with the alignment of the MOT repumper
20250128 - 0165:   That's more like it
20250128 - 0168:   light on , might be slightly off
20250128 - 0171:   try more zeeman power
20250128 - 0172:   worse, perhaps now I need more repumper? No but this is at 2.5 repumper, scratch that. Let's go the other way, less zeeman
20250128 - 0184:   the hell? I don't get it
20250128 - 0187:   what the fuckk man
20250128 - 0191:   I mean it's gotta be something else now. This is absurd, let's just leave it here for a bit
20250128 - 0198:   hoenstly what on earth is going on with this lab, I swear to god this is bullshit
20250129 - 0023:   mmksay, not shabby. Let's go to ODT
20250129 - 0032:   okay thermal cloud, let's cool more in the ODT
20250129 - 0034:   So no scanning -> we need to cool to like 0.7 or so. Let me look back
20250129 - 0037:   still nothing different really? Ugh
